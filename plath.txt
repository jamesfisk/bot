Conversation Among the Ruins 

Through portico of my elegant house you stalk 
With your wild furies, disturbing garlands of fruit 
And the fabulous lutes and peacocks, rending the net 
Of all decorum which holds the whirlwind back. 
Now, rich order of walls is fallen; rooks croak 
Above the appalling ruin; in bleak light 
Of your stormy eye, magic takes flight 
Like a daunted witch, quitting castle when real days break. 


Fractured pillars frame prospects of rock; 
While you stand heroic in coat and tie, I sit 
Composed in Grecian tunic and psyche-knot, 
Rooted to your black look, the play turned tragic: 
With such blight wrought on our bankrupt estate, 
What ceremony of words can patch the havoc ? 


Winter Landscape, with Rooks 

Water in the millrace, through a sluice of stone, 
plunges headlong into that black pond 
where, absurd and out-of-season, a single swan 
floats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind 
which hungers to haul the white reflection down. 


The austere sun descends above the fen, 
an orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look 
longer on this landscape of chagrin; 
feathered dark in thought, I stalk like a rook, 
brooding as the winter night comes on. 


21 


Last summer's reeds are all engraved in ice 

as is your image in my eye; dry frost 
glazes the window of my hurt; what solace 

can be struck from rock to make heart's waste 
grow green again ? Who'd walk in this bleak place ? 

Pursuit 

Dans lefond des forks votre image me suit. 

RACINE 

There is a panther stalks me down: 
One day I'll have my death of him; 
His greed has set the woods aflame, 
He prowls more lordly than the sun. 

Most soft, most suavely glides that step, 
Advancing always at my back; 
From gaunt hemlock, rooks croak havoc: 

The hunt is on, and sprung the trap. 

Flayed by thorns I trek the rocks, 
Haggard through the hot white noon. 
Along red network of his veins 

What fires run, what craving wakes ? 

Insatiate, he ransacks the land 
Condemned by our ancestral fault, 
Crying: blood, let blood be spilt; 

Meat must glut his mouth's raw wound. 

Keen the rending teeth and sweet 
The singeing fury of his fur; 
His kisses parch, each paw's a briar, 

Doom consummates that appetite. 
In the wake of this fierce cat, 
Kindled like torches for his joy, 
Charred and ravened women lie, 

Become his starving body's bait. 

Now hills hatch menace, spawning shade; 
Midnight cloaks the sultry grove; 
The black marauder, hauled by love 

22 


1956 

On fluent haunches, keeps my speed. 

Behind snarled thickets of my eyes 
Lurks the lithe one; in dreams' ambush 
Bright those claws that mar the flesh 

And hungry, hungry, those taut thighs. 

His ardor snares me, lights the trees, 
And I run flaring in my skin; 
What lull, what cool can lap me in 

When burns and brands that yellow gaze? 

I hurl my heart to halt his pace, 
To quench his thirst I squander blood; 
He eats, and still his need seeks food, 

Compels a total sacrifice. 

His voice waylays me, spells a trance, 
The gutted forest falls to ash; 
Appalled by secret want, I rush 

From such assault of radiance. 

Entering the tower of my fears, 
I shut my doors on that dark guilt, 
I bolt the door, each door I bolt. 

Blood quickens, gonging in my ears: 

The panther's tread is on the stairs, 
Coming up and up the stairs. 

 Bucolics 

Mayday: two came to field in such wise: 
'A daisied mead,' each said to each, 
So were they one; so sought they couch, 
Across barbed stile, through flocked brown cows. 


'No pitchforked farmer, please,' she said; 
'May cockcrow guard us safe,' said he; 
By blackthorn thicket, flower spray 
They pitched their coats, come to green bed. 


23 


I95& 

Below: a fen where water stood; 
Aslant: their hill of stinging nettle; 
Then, honor-bound, mute grazing cattle; 
Above: leaf-wraithed white air, white cloud. 


All afternoon these lovers lay 
Until the sun turned pale from warm, 
Until sweet wind changed tune, blew harm: 
Cruel nettles stung her ankles raw. 


Rueful, most vexed, that tender skin 
Should accept so fell a wound, 
He stamped and cracked stalks to the ground 
Which had caused his dear girl pain. 


Now he goes from his rightful road 
And, under honor, will depart; 
While she stands burning, venom-girt, 
In wait for sharper smart to fade. 


 Tale of a Tub 

The photographic chamber of the eye 
records bare painted walls, while an electric light 
flays the chromium nerves of plumbing raw; 
such poverty assaults the ego; caught 
naked in the merely actual room, 
the stranger in the lavatory mirror 
puts on a public grin, repeats our name 
but scrupulously reflects the usual terror. 

Just how guilty are we when the ceiling 
reveals no cracks that can be decoded ? when washbowl 
maintains it has no more holy calling 
than physical ablution, and the towel 
dryly disclaims that fierce troll faces lurk 
in its explicit folds ? or when the window, 
blind with steam, will not admit the dark 
which shrouds our prospects in ambiguous shadow ? 

24 


I95& 


Twenty years ago, the familiar tub 
bred an ample batch of omens; but now 
water faucets spawn no danger; each crab 
and octopus-scrabbling just beyond the view, 
waiting for some accidental break 
in ritual, to strike-is definitely gone; 
the authentic sea denies them and will pluck 
fantastic flesh down to the honest bone. 

We take the plunge; under water our limbs 
waver, faintly green, shuddering away 
from the genuine color of skin; can our dreams 
ever blur the intransigent lines which draw 
the shape that shuts us in ? absolute fact 
intrudes even when the revolted eye 
is closed; the tub exists behind our back: 
its glittering surfaces are blank and true. 

Yet always the ridiculous nude flanks urge 
the fabrication of some cloth to cover 
such starkness; accuracy must not stalk at large: 
each day demands we create our whole world over, 
disguising the constant horror in a coat 
of many-colored fictions; we mask our past 
in the green of eden, pretend future's shining fruit 
can sprout from the navel of this present waste. 

In this particular tub, two knees jut up 
like icebergs, while minute brown hairs rise 
on arms and legs in a fringe of kelp; green soap 
navigates the tidal slosh of seas 
breaking on legendary beaches; in faith 
we shall board our imagined ship and wildly sail 
among sacred islands of the mad till death 
shatters the fabulous stars and makes us real.

 Southern Sunrise 

Color of lemon, mango, peach, 

These storybook villas 

Still dream behind 

Shutters, their balconies 

Fine as hand-

Made lace, or a leaf-and-flower pen-sketch. 

Tilting with the winds, 

On arrowy stems, 

Pineapple-barked, 

A green crescent of palms 

Sends up its forked 

Firework of fronds. 

A quartz-clear dawn 

Inch by bright inch 

Gilds all our Avenue, 

And out of the blue drench 

Of Angels' Bay 

Rises the round red watermelon sun. 

Channel Crossing 

On storm-struck deck, wind sirens caterwaul; 
With each tilt, shock and shudder, our blunt ship 
Cleaves forward into fury; dark as anger, 
Waves wallop, assaulting the stubborn hull. 
Flayed by spray, we take the challenge up, 
Grip the rail, squint ahead, and wonder how much longer 


Such force can last; but beyond, the neutral view 
Shows, rank on rank, the hungry seas advancing. 
Below, rocked havoc-sick, voyagers lie 
Retching in bright orange basins; a refugee 
Sprawls, hunched in black, among baggage, wincing 
Under the strict mask of his agony. 


26 


I95& 

Far from the sweet stench of that perilous air 
In which our comrades are betrayed, we freeze 
And marvel at the smashing nonchalance 
Of nature: what better way to test taut fiber 
Than against this onslaught, these casual blasts of ice 
That wrestle with us like angels; the mere chance 


Of making harbor through this racketing flux 
Taunts us to valor. Blue sailors sang that our journey 
Would be full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched 
With radiance, peacock-colored; instead, bleak rocks 
Jutted early to mark our going, while sky 
Curded over with clouds and chalk cliffs blanched 


In sullen light of the inauspicious day. 
Now, free, by hazard's quirk, from the common ill 
Knocking our brothers down, we strike a stance 
Most mock-heroic, to cloak our waking awe 
At this rare rumpus which no man can control: 
Meek and proud both fall; stark violence 


Lays all walls waste; private estates are torn, 
Ransacked in the public eye. We forsake 
Our lone luck now, compelled by bond, by blood, 
To keep some unsaid pact; perhaps concern 
Is helpless here, quite extra, yet we must make 
The gesture, bend and hold the prone man's head. 


And so we sail toward cities, streets and homes 
Of other men, where statues celebrate 
Brave acts played out in peace, in war; all dangers 
End: green shores appear; we assume our names, 
Our luggage, as docks halt our brief epic; no debt 
Survives arrival; we walk the plank with strangers.

 Prospect 

Among orange-tile rooftops 
and chimney pots 
the fen fog slips, 
gray as rats, 

while on spotted branch 
of the sycamore 
two black rooks hunch 
and darkly glare, 

watching for night, 
with absinthe eye 
cocked on the lone, late, 
passer-by. 

The Queen's Complaint 

In ruck and quibble of courtfolk 
This giant hulked, I tell you, on her scene 
With hands like derricks, 
Looks fierce and black as rooks; 
Why, all the windows broke when he stalked in. 


Her dainty acres he ramped through 
And used her gentle doves with manners rude; 
I do not know 
What fury urged him slay 
Her antelope who meant him naught but good. 


She spoke most chiding in his ear 
Till he some pity took upon her crying; 
Of rich attire 
He made her shoulders bare 
And solaced her, but quit her at cock's crowing. 


28 


1956 

A hundred heralds she sent out 
To summon in her slight all doughty men 
Whose force might fit 
Shape of her sleep, her thought - 
None of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown. 

So she is come to this rare pass 
Whereby she treks in blood through sun and squall 
And sings you thus: 
'How sad, alas, it is 
To see my people shrunk so small, so small.' 

Ode for Ted 

From under crunch of my man's boot 
green oat-sprouts jut; 
he names a lapwing, starts rabbits in a rout 
legging it most nimble 
to sprigged hedge of bramble, 
stalks red fox, shrewd stoat. 


Loam-humps, he says, moles shunt 
up from delved worm-haunt; 
blue fur, moles have; hefting chalk-hulled flint 
he with rock splits open 
knobbed quartz; flayed colors ripen 
rich, brown, sudden in sunglint. 


For his least look, scant acres yield: 
each finger-furrowed field 
heaves forth stalk, leaf, fruit-nubbed emerald; 
bright grain sprung so rarely 
he hauls to his will early; 
at his hand's staunch hest, birds build. 


Ringdoves roost well within his wood, 
shirr songs to suit which mood 
he saunters in; how but most glad 


29 


1956 


could be this adam's woman 
when all earth his words do summon 
leaps to laud such man's blood! 


21 April ig$6 

Firesong 

Born green we were 
to this flawed garden, 
but in speckled thickets, warted as a toad, 
spitefully skulks our warden, 
fixing his snare 
which hauls down buck, cock, trout, till all most fair 
is tricked to falter in spilt blood. 


Now our whole task's to hack 
some angel-shape worth wearing 
from his crabbed midden where all's wrought so awry 
that no straight inquiring 
could unlock 
shrewd catch silting our each bright act back 
to unmade mud cloaked by sour sky. 


Sweet salts warped stem 
of weeds we tackle towards way's rank ending; 
scorched by red sun 
we heft globed flint, racked in veins' barbed bindings; 
brave love, dream 
not of staunching such strict flame, but come, 
lean to my wound; burn on, burn on. 


Song for a Summer's Day 

Through fen and farmland walking 
With my own country love 
I saw slow flocked cows move 

30 


1956 

White hulks on their day's cruising; 
Sweet grass sprang for their grazing. 


The air was bright for looking: 
Most far in blue, aloft, 
Clouds steered a burnished drift; 
Larks' nip and tuck arising 
Came in for my love's praising. 


Sheen of the noon sun striking 
Took my heart as if 
It were a green-tipped leaf 
Kindled by my love's pleasing 
Into an ardent blazing. 


And so, together, talking, 
Through Sunday's honey-air 
We walked (and still walk there - 
Out of the sun's bruising) 
Till the night mists came rising. 


 Two Sisters of Persephone 

Two girls there are: within the house 
One sits; the other, without. 
Daylong a duet of shade and light 
Plays between these. 


In her dark wainscoted room 
The first works problems on 
A mathematical machine. 
Dry ticks mark time 


As she calculates each sum. 
At this barren enterprise 
Rat-shrewd go her squint eyes, 
Root-pale her meager frame. 


3i 


Bronzed as earth, the second lies, 
Hearing ticks blown gold 
Like pollen on bright air. Lulled 
Near a bed of poppies, 


She sees how their red silk flare 
Of petaled blood 
Burns open to sun's blade. 
On that green altar 


Freely become sun's bride, the latter 
Grows quick with seed. 
Grass-couched in her labor's pride, 
She bears a king. Turned bitter 


And sallow as any lemon, 
The other, wry virgin to the last, 
Goes graveward with flesh laid waste, 
Worm-husbanded, yet no woman. 


 Vanity Fair 

Through frost-thick weather 
This witch sidles, fingers crooked, as if 
Caught in a hazardous medium that might 
Merely by its continuing 
Attach her to heaven. 

At eye's envious corner 
Crow's-feet copy veining on stained leaf; 
Cold squint steals sky's color; while bruit 
Of bells calls holy ones, her tongue 
Backtalks at the raven 

Cleaving furred air 
Over her skull's midden; no knife 
Rivals her whetted look, divining what conceit 
Waylays simple girls, church-going, 
And what heart's oven 

32

Craves most to cook batter 
Rich in strayings with every amorous oaf, 
Ready, for a trinket, 
To squander owl-hours on bracken bedding, 
Flesh unshriven. 


Against virgin prayer 
This sorceress sets mirrors enough 
To distract beauty's thought; 
Lovesick at first fond song, 
Each vain girl's driven 


To believe beyond heart's flare 
No fire is, nor in any book proof 
Sun hoists soul up after lids fall shut; 
So she wills all to the black king. 
The worst sloven 


Vies with best queen over 
Right to blaze as satan's wife; 
Housed in earth, those million brides shriek out. 
Some burn short, some long, 
Staked in pride's coven. 


is Strumpet Song 

With white frost gone 
And all green dreams not worth much, 
After a lean day's work 
Time comes round for that foul slut: 
Mere bruit of her takes our street 
Until every man, 
Red, pale or dark, 
Veers to her slouch. 


Mark, I cry, that mouth 
Made to do violence on, 
That seamed face 
Askew with blotch, dint, scar

1956 


Struck by each dour year. 
Walks there not some such one man 
As can spare breath 
To patch with brand of love this rank grimace 
Which out from black tarn, ditch and cup 
Into my most chaste own eyes 
Looks up. 

 Tinker Jack and the Tidy Wives 

'Come lady, bring that pot 

Gone black of polish 

And whatever pan this mending master 

Should trim back to shape.

On silver dish, 

And shine that kettle of copper 

At your fireside 

Bright as blood. 

'Come lady, bring that face 

Fallen from luster. 

Time's soot in bleared eye

Crook-back or bandy-leg, 

But Tinker Jack can forge 

Beauty from hag. 

'Whatever scath 

Fierce fire's wrought

Young wives still blithe, 
Still fair, 
Whose labor's not yet smoked

Faun 

Haunched like a faun, he hooed 
From grove of moon-glint and fen-frost 
Until all owls in the twigged forest 
Flapped black to look and brood 
On the call this man made. 

No sound but a drunken coot 
Lurching home along river bank. 
Stars hung water-sunk, so a rank 
Of double star-eyes lit 
Boughs where those owls sat. 


An arena of yellow eyes 
Watched the changing shape he cut, 
Saw hoof harden from foot, saw sprout 
Goat-horns. Marked how god rose 
And galloped woodward in that guise. 

Street Song 

By a mad miracle I go intact 
Among the common rout 
Thronging sidewalk, street, 
And bickering shops; 
Nobody blinks a lid, gapes, 
Or cries that this raw flesh 

35 


1956 

Reeks of the butcher's cleaver, 
Its heart and guts hung hooked 
And bloodied as a cow's split frame 
Parceled out by white-jacketed assassins. 


Oh no, for I strut it clever 
As a greenly escaped idiot, 
Buying wine, bread, 
Yellow-casqued chrysanthemums - 
Arming myself with the most reasonable items 
To ward off, at all cost, suspicions 
Roused by thorned hands, feet, head, 
And that great wound 
Squandering red 
From the flayed side. 


Even as my each mangled nerve-end 
Trills its hurt out 
Above pitch of pedestrian ear, 
So, perhaps I, knelled dumb by your absence, 
Alone can hear 
Sun's parched scream, 
Every downfall and crash 
Of gutted star, 
And, more daft than any goose, 
This cracked world's incessant gabble and hiss. 


 Letter to a Purist 

That grandiose colossus who 
Stood astride 
The envious assaults of sea

Tide by tide, 
To undo him, perpetually),

O my loxey

O my great idiot, who 
With one foot 
Caught (as it were) in the muck-trap 
Of skin and bone,

In preposterous provinces of the madcap 
Cloud-cuckoo, 
Agawp at the impeccable moon. 

Soliloquy of the Solipsist 

i? 
I walk alone; 
The midnight street 
Spins itself from under my feet; 
When my eyes shut 
These dreaming houses all snuff out; 
Through a whim of mine 
Over gables the moon's celestial onion 
Hangs high. 


I 
Make houses shrink 
And trees diminish 
By going far; my look's leash 
Dangles the puppet-people 
Who, unaware how they dwindle, 
Laugh, kiss, get drunk, 
Nor guess that if I choose to blink 
They die. 


I 
When in good humor, 
Give grass its green 
Blazon sky blue, and endow the sun 
With gold; 
Yet, in my wintriest moods, I hold 
Absolute power 


37 


To boycott color and forbid any flower 
To be. 


I 
Know you appear 
Vivid at my side, 
Denying you sprang out of my head, 
Claiming you feel 
Love fiery enough to prove flesh real, 
Though it's quite clear 
All your beauty, all your wit, is a gift, my dear, 
From me. 


Dialogue Between Ghost and Priest 

In the rectory garden on his evening walk 
Paced brisk Father Shawn. A cold day, a sodden one it was 
In black November. After a sliding rain 
Dew stood in chill sweat on each stalk, 
Each thorn; spiring from wet earth, a blue haze 
Hung caught in dark-webbed branches like a fabulous heron. 


Hauled sudden from solitude, 
Hair prickling on his head, 
Father Shawn perceived a ghost 
Shaping itself from that mist. 


'How now,' Father Shawn crisply addressed the ghost 
Wavering there, gauze-edged, smelling of woodsmoke, 
'What manner of business are you on ? 
From your blue pallor, I'd say you inhabited the frozen waste 
Of hell, and not the fiery part. Yet to judge by that dazzled look, 
That noble mien, perhaps you've late quitted heaven?' 


In voice furred with frost, 
Ghost said to priest: 
'Neither of those countries do I frequent: 
Earth is my haunt.' 


38 



1956 

'Come, come,' Father Shawn gave an impatient shrug, 
'I don't ask you to spin some ridiculous fable 
Of gilded harps or gnawing fire: simply tell 
After your life's end, what just epilogue 
God ordained to follow up your days. Is it such trouble 
To satisfy the questions of a curious old fool?' 


'In life, love gnawed my skin 
To this white bone; 
What love did then, love does now : 
Gnaws me through.' 


'What love,' asked Father Shawn, 'but too great love 
Of flawed earth-flesh could cause this sorry pass ? 
Some damned condition you are in: 
Thinking never to have left the world, you grieve 
As though alive, shriveling in torment thus 
To atone as shade for sin that lured blind man.' 


'The day of doom 
Is not yet come. 
Until that time 
A crock of dust is my dear home.' 


'Fond phantom,' cried shocked Father Shawn, 
'Can there be such stubbornness - 
A soul grown feverish, clutching its dead body-tree 
Like a last storm-crossed leaf? Best get you gone 
To judgment in a higher court of grace. 
Repent, depart, before God's trump-crack splits the sky.' 


From that pale mist 
Ghost swore to priest: 
'There sits no higher court 
Than man's red heart.'

The Glutton 

He, hunger-stung, hard to slake, 
So fitted is for my black luck 
(With heat such as no man could have 
And yet keep kind) 
That all merit's in being meat 
Seasoned how he'd most approve; 
Blood's broth, 
Filched by his hand, 
Choice wassail makes, cooked hot, 
Cupped quick to mouth; 
Though prime parts cram each rich meal, 
He'll not spare 
Nor scant his want until 
Sacked larder's gone bone-bare. 


Monologue at 3 a.m. 

Better that every fiber crack 
and fury make head, 
blood drenching vivid 
couch, carpet, floor 
and the snake-figured almanac 
vouching you are 
a million green counties from here, 

than to sit mute, twitching so 
under prickling stars, 
with stare, with curse 
blackening the time 
goodbyes were said, trains let go, 
and I, great magnanimous fool, thus wrenched from 
my one kingdom.

Miss Drake Proceeds to Supper 

No novice 
In those elaborate rituals 
Which allay the malice 
Of knotted table and crooked chair, 
The new woman in the ward 
Wears purple, steps carefully 
Among her secret combinations of eggshells 
And breakable hummingbirds, 
Footing sallow as a mouse 
Between the cabbage-roses 
Which are slowly opening their furred petals 
To devour and drag her down 
Into the carpet's design. 

With bird-quick eye cocked askew 

She can see in the nick of time 

How perilous needles grain the floorboards 

And outwit their brambled plan; 

Now through her ambushed air, 

Adazzle with bright shards 

Of broken glass, 

She edges with wary breath, 

Fending off jag and tooth, 

Until, turning sideways, 

She lifts one webbed foot after the other 

Into the still, sultry weather 

Of the patients' dining room. 

Recantation

Go to your greenhorn youth 

Before time ends 

And do good 

With your white hands.'

While she, envious bride, 
Cannot follow after, but lies 
With her blank brown eyes starved wide, 
Twisting curses in the tangled sheet 
With taloned fingers, 
Shaking in her skull's cage 
The stuffed shape of her flown mate 
Escaped among moon-plumaged strangers; 
So hungered, she must wait in rage 
Until bird-racketing dawn 
When her shrike-face 
Leans to peck open those locked lids, to eat 
Crowns, palace, all 
That nightlong stole her male, 
And with red beak 
Spike and suck out 
Last blood-drop of that truant heart.

27 Alicante Lullaby 

In Alicante they bowl the barrels 
Bumblingly over the nubs of the cobbles 
Past the yellow-paella eateries, 
Below the ramshackle back-alley balconies, 

While the cocks and hens 
In the roofgardens 
Scuttle repose with crowns and cackles. 

Kumquat-colored trolleys ding as they trundle 
Passengers under an indigo fizzle 
Needling spumily down from the wires: 
Alongside the sibilant harbor the lovers 

Hear loudspeakers boom 
From each neon-lit palm 
Rumbas and sambas no ear-flaps can muffle. 

O Cacophony, goddess of jazz and of quarrels, 
Crack-throated mistress of bagpipes and cymbals, 
Let be your con brios, your capricciosos, 
Crescendos, cadenzas, prestos and prestissimos, 

My head on the pillow 

{Piano, pianissimo) 

Lullayed by susurrous lyres and viols. 

28 Dream with Clam-Diggers 

This dream budded bright with leaves around the edges, 
Its clear air winnowed by angels; she was come 
Back to her early sea-town home 
Scathed, stained after tedious pilgrimages. 


Barefoot, she stood, in shock of that returning, 
Beside a neighbor's house 
With shingles burnished as glass, 
Blinds lowered on that hot morning. 


43 



i95b 

No change met her: garden terrace, all summer 
Tanged by melting tar, 
Sloped seaward to plunge in blue; fed by white fire, 
The whole scene flared welcome to this roamer. 


High against heaven, gulls went wheeling soundless 
Over tidal-flats where three children played 
Silent and shining on a green rock bedded in mud, 
Their fabulous heyday endless. 


With green rock gliding, a delicate schooner 
Decked forth in cockle-shells, 
They sailed till tide foamed round their ankles 
And the fair ship sank, its crew knelled home for dinner. 


Plucked back thus sudden to that far innocence, 
She, in her shabby travel garb, began 
Walking eager toward water, when there, one by one, 
Clam-diggers rose up out of dark slime at her offense. 


Grim as gargoyles from years spent squatting at sea's border 
In wait amid snarled weed and wrack of wave 
To trap this wayward girl at her first move of love, 
Now with stake and pitchfork they advance, flint eyes fixed on murder. 


 Wreath for a Bridal 

What though green leaves only witness 
Such pact as is made once only; what matter 
That owl voice sole 'yes', while cows utter 
Low moos of approve; let sun surpliced in brightness 
Stand stock still to laud these mated ones 
Whose stark act all coming double luck joins. 


Couched daylong in cloisters of stinging nettle 
They lie, cut-grass assaulting each separate sense 
With savor; coupled so, pure paragons of Constance, 
This pair seek single state from that dual battle. 
Now speak some sacrament to parry scruple 
For wedlock wrought within love's proper chapel. 


44 



1956 

Call here with flying colors all watchful birds 
To people the twigged aisles; lead babel tongues 
Of animals to choir: 'Look what thresh of wings 
Wields guard of honor over these!' Starred with words 
Let night bless that luck-rooted mead of clover 
Where, bedded like angels, two burn one in fever. 

From this holy day on, all pollen blown 
Shall strew broadcast so rare a seed on wind 
That every breath, thus teeming, set the land 
Sprouting fruit, flowers, children most fair in legion 
To slay spawn of dragon's teeth: speaking this promise, 
Let flesh be knit, and each step hence go famous. 

Epitaph for Fire and Flower 

You might as well haul up 
This wave's green peak on wire 
To prevent fall, or anchor the fluent air 
In quartz, as crack your skull to keep 
These two most perishable lovers from the touch 
That will kindle angels' envy, scorch and drop 
Their fond hearts charred as any match. 


Seek no stony camera-eye to fix 
The passing dazzle of each face 
In black and white, or put on ice 
Mouth's instant flare for future looks; 
Stars shoot their petals, and suns run to seed, 
However you may sweat to hold such darling wrecks 
Hived like honey in your head. 

Now in the crux of their vows hang your ear, 
Still as a shell: hear what an age of glass 
These lovers prophesy to lock embrace 
Secure in museum diamond for the stare 
Of astounded generations; they wrestle 
To conquer cinder's kingdom in the stroke of an hour 
And hoard faith safe in a fossil. 

45 



But though they'd rivet sinews in rock 
And have every weathercock kiss hang fire 
As if to outflame a phoenix, the moment's spur 
Drives nimble blood too quick 
For a wish to tether: they ride nightlong 
In their heartbeats' blazing wake until red cock 
Plucks bare that comet's flowering. 

Dawn snuffs out star's spent wick, 
Even as love's dear fools cry evergreen, 
And a languor of wax congeals the vein 
No matter how fiercely lit; staunch contracts break 
And recoil in the altering light: the radiant limb 
Blows ash in each lover's eye; the ardent look 
Blackens flesh to bone and devours them. 

Fiesta Melons 

In Benidorm there are melons, 
Whole donkey-carts full 


Of innumerable melons, 
Ovals and balls, 


Bright green and thumpable 
Laced over with stripes 


Of turtle-dark green. 
Choose an egg-shape, a world-shape, 


Bowl one homeward to taste 
In the whitehot noon: 


Cream-smooth honeydews, 
Pink-pulped whoppers, 


Bump-rinded cantaloupes 
With orange cores. 


46 



'956 

Each wedge wears a studding 
Of blanched seeds or black seeds 

To strew like confetti 
Under the feet of 


This market of melon-eating 
Fiesta-goers. 

32 The Goring 

Arena dust rusted by four bulls' blood to a dull redness, 
The afternoon at a bad end under the crowd's truculence, 
The ritual death each time botched among dropped capes, ill-judged 


stabs, 
The strongest will seemed a will toward ceremony. Obese, dark-
Faced in his rich yellows, tassels, pompons, braid, the picador 

Rode out against the fifth bull to brace his pike and slowly bear 
Down deep into the bent bull-neck. Cumbrous routine, not artwork. 
Instinct for art began with the bull's horn lofting in the mob's 
Hush a lumped man-shape. The whole act formal, fluent as a dance. 
Blood faultlessly broached redeemed the sullied air, the earth's grossness. 


33 The Beggars 

Nightfall, cold eye-neither disheartens 
These goatish tragedians who 
Hawk misfortune like figs and chickens 

And, plaintiff against each day, decry 
Nature's partial, haphazard thumb. 
Under white wall and Moorish window 

Griefs honest grimace, debased by time, 
Caricatures itself and thrives 
On the coins of pity. At random 

47 



1956 


A beggar stops among eggs and loaves, 
Props a leg-stump upon a crutch, 
Jiggles his tin cup at the good wives. 

By lack and loss these beggars encroach 
On spirits tenderer than theirs, 
Suffering-toughened beyond the fetch 

Of finest conscience. 

Nightfall obscures 
The bay's sheer, extravagant blue, 
White house and almond grove. The beggars 

Outlast their evilest star, wryly 
And with a perfidious verve 
Baffle the dark, the pitying eye. 


Spider 

Anansi, black busybody of the folktales, 
You scuttle out on impulse 
Blunt in self-interest 
As a sledge hammer, as a man's bunched fist, 
Yet of devils the cleverest 
To get your carousals told: 
You spun the cosmic web: you squint from center field. 


Last summer I came upon your Spanish cousin, 
Notable robber baron, 
Behind a goatherd's hut: 
Near his small stonehenge above the ants' route, 
One-third ant-size, a leggy spot, 
He tripped an ant with a rope 
Scarcely visible. About and about the slope 


Of his redoubt he ran his nimble filament, 
Each time round winding that ant 
Tighter to the cocoon 
Already veiling the gray spool of stone 


48 



I95& 

From which coils, caught ants waved legs in 
Torpid warning, or lay still 
And suffered their livelier fellows to struggle. 

Then briskly scaled his altar tiered with tethered ants, 
Nodding in a somnolence 
Appalling to witness, 
To the barbarous outlook, from there chose 
His next martyr to the gross cause 
Of concupiscence. Once more 
With black alacrity bound round his prisoner. 

The ants-a file of comers, a file of goers- 
Persevered on a set course 
No scruple could disrupt, 
Obeying orders of instinct till swept 
Off-stage and infamously wrapped 
Up by a spry black deus 
Ex machina. Nor did they seem deterred by this. 

Spinster 

Now this particular girl 
During a ceremonious April walk 
With her latest suitor 
Found herself, of a sudden, intolerably struck 
By the birds' irregular babel 
And the leaves' litter. 


By this tumult afflicted, she 
Observed her lover's gestures unbalance the air, 
His gait stray uneven 
Through a rank wilderness of fern and flower. 
She judged petals in disarray, 
The whole season, sloven. 


How she longed for winter then! - 
Scrupulously austere in its order 
Of white and black 
Ice and rock, each sentiment within border, 


49 



I95& 

And heart's frosty discipline 
Exact as a snowflake. 

But here-a burgeoning 

Unruly enough to pitch her five queenly wits 
Into vulgar motley - 

A treason not to be borne. Let idiots 

Reel giddy in bedlam spring: 

She withdrew neatly. 

And round her house she set 
Such a barricade of barb and check 
Against mutinous weather 
As no mere insurgent man could hope to break 
With curse, fist, threat 
Or love, either. 

Rhyme 

I've got a stubborn goose whose gut's 
Honeycombed with golden eggs, 
Yet won't lay one. 
She, addled in her goose-wit, struts 
The barnyard like those taloned hags 
Who ogle men 


And crimp their wrinkles in a grin, 
Jangling their great money bags. 
While I eat grits 
She fattens on the finest grain. 
Now, as I hone my knife, she begs 
Pardon, and that's 


So humbly done, I'd turn this keen 
Steel on myself before profit 
By such a rogue's 
Act, but-how those feathers shine! 


Exit from a smoking slit 
Her ruby dregs.

Departure 


The figs on the fig tree in the yard are green; 
Green, also, the grapes on the green vine 
Shading the brickred porch tiles. 
The money's run out. 


How nature, sensing this, compounds her bitters. 
Ungifted, ungrieved, our leavetaking. 
The sun shines on unripe corn. 
Cats play in the stalks. 


Retrospect shall not soften such penury- 
Sun's brass, the moon's steely patinas, 
The leaden slag of the world - 
But always expose 


The scraggy rock spit shielding the town's blue bay 
Against which the brunt of outer sea 
Beats, is brutal endlessly. 
Gull-fouled, a stone hut 


Bares its low lintel to corroding weathers: 
Across the jut of ochreous rock 
Goats shamble, morose, rank-haired, 
To lick the sea-salt. 


Maudlin 

Mud-mattressed under the sign of the hag 
In a clench of blood, the sleep-talking virgin 
Gibbets with her curse the moon's man, 
Faggot-bearing Jack in his crackless egg: 


Hatched with a claret hogshead to swig 
He kings it, navel-knit to no groan, 
But at the price of a pin-stitched skin 
Fish-tailed girls purchase each white leg.

Day of mist: day of tarnish

and the coal fire burns 

outside, the little hedge leaves are

a milk-film blurs 
the empty bottles on the windowsill

Landowners 

From my rented attic with no earth 
To call my own except the air-motes, 
I malign the leaden perspective 
Of identical gray brick houses, 
Orange roof-tiles, orange chimney pots, 
And see that first house, as if between 
Mirrors, engendering a spectral 
Corridor of inane replicas, 
Flimsily peopled. 


But landowners 
Own their cabbage roots, a space of stars, 
Indigenous peace. Such substance makes 
My eyeful of reflections a ghost's 
Eyeful, which, envious, would define 
Death as striking root on one land-tract; 
Life, its own vaporous wayfarings. 

Ella Mason and Her Eleven Cats 

Old Ella Mason keeps cats, eleven at last count, 
In her ramshackle house off Somerset Terrace; 
People make queries 
On seeing our neighbor's cat-haunt, 
Saying: 'Something's addled in a woman who accommodates 
That many cats.' 


Rum and red-faced as a water-melon, her voice 
Long gone to wheeze and seed, Ella Mason 
For no good reason 
Plays hostess to Tabby, Tom and increase, 
With cream and chicken-gut feasting the palates 
Of finical cats. 


Village stories go that in olden days 
Ella flounced about, minx-thin and haughty, 
A fashionable beauty, 


53 



Slaying the dandies with her emerald eyes; 
Now, run to fat, she's a spinster whose door shuts 
On all but cats. 


Once we children sneaked over to spy Miss Mason 
Napping in her kitchen paved with saucers. 
On antimacassars 
Table-top, cupboard shelf, cats lounged brazen, 
One gruff-timbred purr rolling from furred throats: 
Such stentorian cats! 


With poke and giggle, ready to skedaddle, 
We peered agog through the cobwebbed door 
Straight into yellow glare 
Of guardian cats crouched round their idol, 
While Ella drowsed whiskered with sleek face, sly wits: 
Sphinx-queen of cats. 


'Look! there she goes, Cat-Lady Mason!' 
We snickered as she shambled down Somerset Terrace 
To market for her dearies, 
More mammoth and blowsy with every season; 
'Miss Ella's got loony from keeping in cahoots 
With eleven cats.' 


But now turned kinder with time, we mark Miss Mason 
Blinking green-eyed and solitary 
At girls who marry- 
Demure ones, lithe ones, needing no lesson 
That vain jades sulk single down bridal nights, 
Accurst as wild-cats. 


 Crystal Gazer 

Gerd sits spindle-shanked in her dark tent, 
Lean face gone tawn with seasons, 
Skin worn down to the knucklebones 
At her tough trade; without time's taint 
The burnished ball hangs fire in her hands, a lens 
Fusing time's three horizons. 


54 


Two enter to tap her sight, a green pair 
Fresh leaved out in vows: 'Come tell 
How we shall do together, 
Well or ill.' Gerd slants a look at each: most dear, 
Each to the other; fit fiber for stern weather. 
Slowly she spins the ball: 


'I see two stalwart apple trees 
Coupled by branches intertwined 
And, springing all about, 
Staunch saplings; to this house, thriving days 
Will bring crop's increase, and harvest fruit 
Follow on kind wind.' 


'No hardship then ?' he asks. 'We'll take 
Whatever trial's to come, so say true.' 
His bride echoes his word. At that, 
Gerd whirls the ball ablaze: 'Rough storm,' she grants, 'may wreak 
Some havoc on tender limb, and yet 
Strengthen that orchard thereby.' 


Their small price paid, these wedded ones 
Walk forth into sun-moneyed air, quickened 
To savor their span of flourishing. 
Aloof, squatting mummy-wise, Gerd scans 
That clairvoyant quartz which once, at her own wishing, 
Exacted her first simple sight for this strict second. 


Then, a free-gadding hoyden, Gerd had craved 
To govern more sight than given to a woman 
By wits alone: to foresee her lover's faith 
And their future lot, she braved 
Church curse to ken that crooked oath 
Whereby one hires a demon. 


A flash like doomcrack rent night's black: 
God's work stood anchored in that glare 
Focusing all time's day-suns in one 
So beggar Gerd might aim her look 
At gorgon-prospects with power to strike to stone 
Hearts of those who pierced time's core. 


55 



I95& 

What Gerd saw then engraved her mind 
Plague-pitted as the moon: each bud 
Shriveling to cinders at its source, 
Each love blazing blind to its gutted end - 
And, fixed in the crystal center, grinning fierce: 
Earth's ever-green death's head. 


43 November Graveyard 

The scene stands stubborn: skinflint trees 
Hoard last year's leaves, won't mourn, wear sackcloth, or turn 
To elegiac dryads, and dour grass 
Guards the hard-hearted emerald of its grassiness 
However the grandiloquent mind may scorn 
Such poverty. No dead men's cries 


Flower forget-me-nots between the stones 
Paving this grave ground. Here's honest rot 
To unpick the heart, pare bone 
Free of the fictive vein. When one stark skeleton 
Bulks real, all saints' tongues fall quiet: 
Flies watch no resurrections in the sun. 


At the essential landscape stare, stare 
Till your eyes foist a vision dazzling on the wind: 
Whatever lost ghosts flare, 
Damned, howling in their shrouds across the moor 
Rave on the leash of the starving mind 
Which peoples the bare room, the blank, untenanted air. 


44 Black Rook in Rainy Weather 

On the stiff twig up there 
Hunches a wet black rook 
Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain. 
I do not expect a miracle 
Or an accident 

56 


I95& 

To set the sight on fire 
In my eye, nor seek 
Any more in the desultory weather some design, 
But let spotted leaves fall as they fall, 
Without ceremony, or portent. 


Although, I admit, I desire, 
Occasionally, some backtalk 
From the mute sky, I can't honestly complain: 
A certain minor light may still 
Lean incandescent 


Out of kitchen table or chair 
As if a celestial burning took 
Possession of the most obtuse objects now and then- 
Thus hallowing an interval 
Otherwise inconsequent 


By bestowing largesse, honor, 
One might say love. At any rate, I now walk 
Wary (for it could happen 
Even in this dull, ruinous landscape); skeptical, 
Yet politic; ignorant 


Of whatever angel may choose to flare 
Suddenly at my elbow. I only know that a rook 
Ordering its black feathers can so shine 
As to seize my senses, haul 
My eyelids up, and grant 


A brief respite from fear 
Of total neutrality. With luck, 
Trekking stubborn through this season 
Of fatigue, I shall 
Patch together a content 


Of sorts. Miracles occur, 
If you care to call those spasmodic 
Tricks of radiance miracles. The wait's begun again, 
The long wait for the angel, 
For that rare, random descent.

The Snowman on the Moor 

Stalemated their armies stood, with tottering banners: 
She flung from a room 
Still ringing with bruit of insults and dishonors 


And in fury left him 
Glowering at the coal-fire: 'Come find me' -her last taunt. 
He did not come 


But sat on, guarding his grim battlement. 
By the doorstep 
Her winter-beheaded daisies, marrowless, gaunt, 


Warned her to keep 
Indoors with politic goodwill, not haste 
Into a landscape 


Of stark wind-harrowed hills and weltering mist; 
But from the house 
She stalked intractable as a driven ghost 


Across moor snows 
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must yet win 
Him to his knees- 


Let him send police and hounds to bring her in. 
Nursing her rage 
Through bare whistling heather, over stiles of black stone, 


58 



'957 

To the world's white edge 
She came, and called hell to subdue an unruly man 
And join her siege. 


It was no fire-blurting fork-tailed demon 
Volcanoed hot 
From marble snow-heap of moor to ride that woman 


With spur and knout 
Down from pride's size: instead, a grisly-thewed, 
Austere, corpse-white 


Giant heaved into the distance, stone-hatcheted, 
Sky-high, and snow 
Floured his whirling beard, and at his tread 


Ambushed birds by 
Dozens dropped dead in the hedges: o she felt 
No love in his eye, 


Worse-saw dangling from that spike-studded belt 
Ladies' sheaved skulls: 
Mournfully the dry tongues clacked their guilt: 


'Our wit made fools 
Of kings, unmanned kings' sons: our masteries 
Amused court halls: 


For that brag, we barnacle these iron thighs.' 
Throned in the thick 
Of a blizzard, the giant roared up with his chittering trophies. 


From brunt of axe-crack 
She shied sideways: a white fizz! and the giant, pursuing, 
Crumbled to smoke. 


Humbled then, and crying, 
The girl bent homeward, brimful of gentle talk 
And mild obeying. 


59

Mayflower 

Throughout black winter the red haws withstood 
Assault of snow-flawed winds from the dour skies 
And, bright as blood-drops, proved no brave branch dies 
If root's firm-fixed and resolution good. 
Now, as green sap ascends the steepled wood, 
Each hedge with such white bloom astounds our eyes 
As sprang from Joseph's rod, and testifies 
How best beauty's born of hardihood. 

So when staunch island stock chose forfeiture 
Of the homeland hearth to plough their pilgrim way 
Across Atlantic furrows, dark, unsure- 
Remembering the white, triumphant spray 
On hawthorn boughs, with goodwill to endure 
They named their ship after the flower of May. 

Sow 

God knows how our neighbor managed to breed 
His great sow: 
Whatever his shrewd secret, he kept it hid 


In the same way 
He kept the sow-impounded from public stare, 
Prize ribbon and pig show. 


But one dusk our questions commended us to a tour 
Through his lantern-lit 
Maze of barns to the lintel of the sunk sty door 


To gape at it: 
This was no rose-and-larkspurred china suckling 
With a penny slot 


For thrifty children, nor dolt pig ripe for heckling, 
About to be 
Glorified for prime flesh and golden crackling 


60 


1957 


In a parsley halo; 
Nor even one of the common barnyard sows, 
Mire-smirched, blowzy, 


Maunching thistle and knotweed on her snout-cruise- 
Bloat tun of milk 
On the move, hedged by a litter of feat-foot ninnies 


Shrilling her hulk 
To halt for a swig at the pink teats. No. This vast 
Brobdingnag bulk 


Of a sow lounged belly-bedded on that black compost, 
Fat-rutted eyes 
Dream-filmed. What a vision of ancient hoghood must 


Thus wholly engross 
The great grandam! -our marvel blazoned a knight, 
Helmed, in cuirass, 


Unhorsed and shredded in the grove of combat 
By a grisly-bristled 
Boar, fabulous enough to straddle that sow's heat. 


But our farmer whistled, 
Then, with a jocular fist thwacked the barrel nape, 
And the green-copse-castled 


Pig hove, letting legend like dried mud drop, 
Slowly, grunt 
On grunt, up in the flickering light to shape 


A monument 
Prodigious in gluttonies as that hog whose want 
Made lean Lent 


Of kitchen slops and, stomaching no constraint, 
Proceeded to swill 
The seven troughed seas and every earthquaking continent.

The Everlasting Monday 

Thou shalt have an everlasting 
Monday and stand in the moon. 

The moon's man stands in his shell, 
Bent under a bundle 
Of sticks. The light falls chalk and cold 
Upon our bedspread. 
His teeth are chattering among the leprous 
Peaks and craters of those extinct volcanoes. 


He also against black frost 
Would pick sticks, would not rest 
Until his own lit room outshone 
Sunday's ghost of sun; 
Now works his hell of Mondays in the moon's 
Fireless, seven chill seas chained to his ankle. 


Hardcastle Crags 

Flintlike, her feet struck 
Such a racket of echoes from the steely street, 
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the black 
Stone-built town, that she heard the quick air ignite 
Its tinder and shake 

A firework of echoes from wall 
To wall of the dark, dwarfed cottages. 
But the echoes died at her back as the walls 
Gave way to fields and the incessant seethe of grasses 
Riding in the full 

Of the moon, manes to the wind, 
Tireless, tied, as a moon-bound sea 
Moves on its root. Though a mist-wraith wound 
Up from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high 
Ahead, it fattened 

62 


1957 


To no family-featured ghost, 
Nor did any word body with a name 
The blank mood she walked in. Once past 
The dream-peopled village, her eyes entertained no dream, 
And the sandman's dust 

Lost lustre under her footsoles. 
The long wind, paring her person down 
To a pinch of flame, blew its burdened whistle 
In the whorl of her ear, and like a scooped-out pumpkin crown 
Her head cupped the babel. 

All the night gave her, in return 
For the paltry gift of her bulk and the beat 
Of her heart, was the humped indifferent iron 
Of its hills, and its pastures bordered by black stone set 
On black stone. Barns 

Guarded broods and litters 
Behind shut doors; the dairy herds 
Knelt in the meadow mute as boulders; 
Sheep drowsed stoneward in their tussocks of wool, and birds, 
Twig-sleeping, wore 

Granite ruffs, their shadows 
The guise of leaves. The whole landscape 
Loomed absolute as the antique world was 
Once, in its earliest sway of lymph and sap, 
Unaltered by eyes, 

Enough to snuff the quick 
Of her small heat out, but before the weight 
Of stones and hills of stones could break 
Her down to mere quartz grit in that stony light 
She turned back.

The Thin People 

They are always with us, the thin people 
Meager of dimension as the gray people 


On a movie-screen. They 
Are unreal, we say: 


It was only in a movie, it was only 
In a war making evil headlines when we 


Were small that they famished and 
Grew so lean and would not round 


Out their stalky limbs again though peace 
Plumped the bellies of the mice 


Under the meanest table. 
It was during the long hunger-battle 


They found their talent to persevere 
In thinness, to come, later, 


Into our bad dreams, their menace 
Not guns, not abuses, 


But a thin silence. 
Wrapped in flea-ridden donkey skins, 


Empty of complaint, forever 
Drinking vinegar from tin cups: they wore 


The insufferable nimbus of the lot-drawn 
Scapegoat. But so thin, 


So weedy a race could not remain in dreams, 
Could not remain outlandish victims 


In the contracted country of the head 
Any more than the old woman in her mud hut could 


64 



1957 


Keep from cutting fat meat 

Out of the side of the generous moon when it 

Set foot nightly in her yard 

Until her knife had pared 

The moon to a rind of little light. 

Now the thin people do not obliterate 

Themselves as the dawn 

Grayness blues, reddens, and the outline 

Of the world comes clear and fills with color. 
They persist in the sunlit room: the wallpaper 

Frieze of cabbage-roses and cornflowers pales 
Under their thin-lipped smiles, 

Their withering kingship. 

How they prop each other up! 

We own no wildernesses rich and deep enough 
For stronghold against their stiff 

Battalions. See, how the tree boles flatten 

And lose their good browns 

If the thin people simply stand in the forest, 

Making the world go thin as a wasp's nest 

And grayer; not even moving their bones. 

 On the Difficulty of Conjuring Up 
a Dryad 

Ravening through the persistent bric-a-brac 

Of blunt pencils, rose-sprigged coffee cup, 

Postage stamps, stacked books' clamor and yawp, 

65 



1957 


Neighborhood cockcrow-all nature's prodigal backtalk, 
The vaunting mind 
Snubs impromptu spiels of wind 
And wrestles to impose 
Its own order on what is. 

'With my fantasy alone,' brags the importunate head, 
Arrogant among rook-tongued spaces, 
Sheep greens, finned falls, 'I shall compose a crisis 
To stun sky black out, drive gibbering mad 


Trout, cock, ram, 
That bulk so calm 
On my jealous stare, 
Self-sufficient as they are.' 


But no hocus-pocus of green angels 
Damasks with dazzle the threadbare eye; 
'My trouble, doctor, is: I see a tree, 
And that damn scrupulous tree won't practice wiles 


To beguile sight: 
E.g., by cant of light 
Concoct a Daphne; 
My tree stays tree. 


'However I wrench obstinate bark and trunk 
To my sweet will, no luminous shape 
Steps out radiant in limb, eye, lip, 
To hoodwink the honest earth which pointblank 

Spurns such fiction 
As nymphs; cold vision 
Will have no counterfeit 
Palmed off on it. 


'No doubt now in dream-propertied fall some moon-eyed, 
Star-lucky sleight-of-hand man watches 
My jilting lady squander coin, gold leaf stock ditches, 
And the opulent air go studded with seed, 


While this beggared brain 
Hatches no fortune, 
But from leaf, from grass, 
Thieves what it has.' 


66 



1957 

On the Plethora of Dryads 

Hearing a white saint rave 
About a quintessential beauty 
Visible only to the paragon heart, 
I tried my sight on an apple-tree 
That for eccentric knob and wart 
Had all my love. 


Without meat or drink I sat 
Starving my fantasy down 
To discover that metaphysical Tree which hid 
From my worldling look its brilliant vein 
Far deeper in gross wood 
Than axe could cut. 


But before I might blind sense 
To see with the spotless soul, 
Each particular quirk so ravished me 
Every pock and stain bulked more beautiful 
Than flesh of any body 
Flawed by love's prints. 


Battle however I would 
To break through that patchwork 
Of leaves' bicker and whisk in babel tongues, 
Streak and mottle of tawn bark, 
No visionary lightnings 
Pierced my dense lid. 


Instead, a wanton fit 
Dragged each dazzled sense apart 
Surfeiting eye, ear, taste, touch, smell; 
Now, snared by this miraculous art, 
I ride earth's burning carrousel 
Day in, day out, 


And such grit corrupts my eyes 
I must watch sluttish dryads twitch 


67 


1957 


Their multifarious silks in the holy grove 
Until no chaste tree but suffers blotch 
Under flux of those seductive 
Reds, greens, blues. 

The Other Two 

All summer we moved in a villa brimful of echoes, 
Cool as the pearled interior of a conch. 
Bells, hooves, of the high-stepping black goats woke us. 
Around our bed the baronial furniture 
Foundered through levels of light seagreen and strange. 
Not one leaf wrinkled in the clearing air. 
We dreamed how we were perfect, and we were. 


Against bare, whitewashed walls, the furniture 
Anchored itself, griffin-legged and darkly grained. 
Two of us in a place meant for ten more- 
Our footsteps multiplied in the shadowy chambers, 
Our voices fathomed a profounder sound: 
The walnut banquet table, the twelve chairs 
Mirrored the intricate gestures of two others. 


Heavy as statuary, shapes not ours 
Performed a dumbshow in the polished wood, 
That cabinet without windows or doors: 
He lifts an arm to bring her close, but she 
Shies from his touch: his is an iron mood. 
Seeing her freeze, he turns his face away. 
They poise and grieve as in some old tragedy. 


Moon-blanched and implacable, he and she 
Would not be eased, released. Our each example 
Of tenderness dove through their purgatory 
Like a planet, a stone, swallowed in a great darkness, 
Leaving no sparky track, setting up no ripple. 
Nightly we left them in their desert place. 
Lights out, they dogged us, sleepless and envious: 


68 



1957 


We dreamed their arguments, their stricken voices. 
We might embrace, but those two never did, 
Come, so unlike us, to a stiff impasse, 
Burdened in such a way we seemed the lighter- 
Ourselves the haunters, and they, flesh and blood; 
As if, above love's ruinage, we were 
The heaven those two dreamed of, in despair. 


The Lady and the Earthenware Head 

Fired in sanguine clay, the model head 
Fit nowhere: brickdust-complected, eye under a dense lid, 
On the long bookshelf it stood 
Stolidly propping thick volumes of prose: spite-set 
Ape of her look. Best rid 
Hearthstone at once of the outrageous head; 
Still, she felt loath to junk it. 


No place, it seemed, for the effigy to fare 
Free from all molesting. Rough boys, 
Spying a pate to spare 
Glowering sullen and pompous from an ash-heap, 
Might well seize this prize, 
Maltreat the hostage head in shocking wise, 
And waken the sly nerve up 


That knits to each original its coarse copy. A dark tarn 
She thought of then, thick-silted, with weeds obscured, 
To serve her exacting turn: 
But out of the watery aspic, laureled by fins, 
The simulacrum leered, 
Lewdly beckoning, and her courage wavered: 
She blenched, as one who drowns, 


And resolved more ceremoniously to lodge 
The mimic head-in a crotched willow, green-
Vaulted by foliage: 
Let bell-tongued birds descant in blackest feather 
On the rendering, grain by grain, 


69 



1957 

Of that uncouth shape to simple sod again 
Through drear and dulcet weather. 


Yet, shrined on her shelf, the grisly visage endured, 
Despite her wrung hands, her tears, her praying: Vanish! 
Steadfast and evil-starred, 
It ogled through rock-fault, wind-flaw and fisted wave - 
An antique hag-head, too tough for knife to finish, 
Refusing to diminish 
By one jot its basilisk-look of love. 


All the Dead Dears 

In the Archaeological Museum in Cambridge is a stone 
coffin of the fourth century A.D. containing the skeletons 
of a woman, a mouse and a shrew. The ankle-bone of the 
woman has been slightly gnawn. 

Rigged poker-stiff on her back 
With a granite grin 
This antique museum-cased lady 
Lies, companioned by the gimcrack 
Relics of a mouse and a shrew 
That battened for a day on her ankle-bone. 


These three, unmasked now, bear 
Dry witness 
To the gross eating game 
We'd wink at if we didn't hear 
Stars grinding, crumb by crumb, 
Our own grist down to its bony face. 


How they grip us through thin and thick, 
These barnacle dead! 
This lady here's no kin 
Of mine, yet kin she is: she'll suck 
Blood and whistle my marrow clean 
To prove it. As I think now of her head, 


From the mercury-backed glass 
Mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother 
Reach hag hands to haul me in, 


70 


1957 


And an image looms under the fishpond surface 
Where the daft father went down 
With orange duck-feet winnowing his hair- 


All the long gone darlings: they 
Get back, though, soon, 
Soon: be it by wakes, weddings, 
Childbirths or a family barbecue: 
Any touch, taste, tang's 
Fit for those outlaws to ride home on, 


And to sanctuary: usurping the armchair 
Between tick 
And tack of the clock, until we go, 
Each skulled-and-crossboned Gulliver 
Riddled with ghosts, to lie 
Deadlocked with them, taking root as cradles rock. 


Natural History 

That lofty monarch, Monarch Mind, 
Blue-blooded in coarse country reigned; 
Though he bedded in ermine, gorged on roast, 
Pure Philosophy his love engrossed: 
While subjects hungered, empty-pursed, 
With stars, with angels, he conversed 


Till, sick of their ruler's godling airs, 
In one body those earthborn commoners 
Rose up and put royal nerves to the rack: 
King Egg-Head saw his domain crack, 
His crown usurped by the low brow 
Of the base, barbarous Prince Ow. 


Two Views of Withens 

Above whorled, spindling gorse, 
Sheepfoot-flattened grasses, 
Stone wall and ridgepole rise 

7i 


1957 

Prow-like through blurs 
Of fog in that hinterland few 
Hikers get to: 


Home of uncatchable 
Sage hen and spry rabbit, 
Where second wind, hip boot 
Help over hill 
And hill, and through peaty water. 
I found bare moor, 


A colorless weather, 
And the House of Eros 
Low-lintelled, no palace; 
You, luckier, 
Report white pillars, a blue sky, 
The ghosts, kindly. 


The Great Carbuncle 

We came over the moor-top 
Through air streaming and green-lit, 
Stone farms foundering in it, 
Valleys of grass altering 
In a light neither of dawn 

Nor nightfall, our hands, faces 
Lucent as porcelain, the earth's 
Claim and weight gone out of them. 
Some such transfiguring moved 
The eight pilgrims towards its source - 

Toward that great jewel: shown often, 
Never given; hidden, yet 
Simultaneously seen 
On moor-top, at sea-bottom, 
Knowable only by light 

Other than noon, than moon, stars- 
The once-known way becoming 

72 


1957 

Wholly other, and ourselves 
Estranged, changed, suspended where 
Angels are rumored, clearly 


Floating, among the floating 
Tables and chairs. Gravity's 
Lost in the lift and drift of 
An easier element 
Than earth, and there is nothing 


So fine we cannot do it. 
But nearing means distancing: 
At the common homecoming 
Light withdraws. Chairs, tables drop 
Down: the body weighs like stone. 


Words for a Nursery 

Rosebud, knot of worms, 
Heir of the first five 
Shapers, I open: 
Five moony crescents 
For eyes to light me 
Toward what I can grab, 
Milk-spout, big finger 
So many ladders 
Giving a leg up 
To these limber hooks. 


I learn, good circus 
Dog that I am, how 
To move, serve, steer food, 
Index the arrow, 
Thumbhead, blunt helper, 
My master's fetcher, 
Whipper of itches, 
No pocket dozer, 
I shut on the key 
Of this blue-green toy. 


73 


1957 

Five-antlered, branching 
Touchy antenna, 
I nose out the lay 
Of thistle and silk, 
Cold pole and hot plate. 
Old historian, 
My page this desert 
Crossed by three causeways, 
Leathery, treeless, 
With five whorled landspits. 


Brown-backed, white-bellied 
As a flatfish, I 
Swim the Sea of Do, 
The left my lackey, 
My backward image. 
Penbearer, scrubnurse, 
The captain's batman, 
By heart here I hold 
Coin, button, trigger 
And his love's body. 


Ill-served he'll be when 
Age manhandles me 
(A crab to nap on 
Chairarms and tables, 
Five wickless candles 
To wag at the dark) 
And worse-served when death 
Makes off with this rose, 
Five worms in a box 
To feed the thin crows. 


 The Disquieting Muses 

Mother, mother, what illbred aunt 
Or what disfigured and unsightly 
Cousin did you so unwisely keep 
Unasked to my christening, that she 
Sent these ladies in her stead 

74 


1957 

With heads like darning-eggs to nod 
And nod and nod at foot and head 
And at the left side of my crib ? 


Mother, who made to order stories 
Of Mixie Blackshort the heroic bear, 
Mother, whose witches always, always 
Got baked into gingerbread, I wonder 
Whether you saw them, whether you said 
Words to rid me of those three ladies 
Nodding by night around my bed, 
Mouthless, eyeless, with stitched bald head. 


In the hurricane, when father's twelve 
Study windows bellied in 
Like bubbles about to break, you fed 
My brother and me cookies and Ovaltine 
And helped the two of us to choir: 
'Thor is angry: boom boom boom! 
Thor is angry: we don't care!' 
But those ladies broke the panes. 


When on tiptoe the schoolgirls danced, 
Blinking flashlights like fireflies 
And singing the glowworm song, I could 
Not lift a foot in the twinkle-dress 
But, heavy-footed, stood aside 
In the shadow cast by my dismal-headed 
Godmothers, and you cried and cried: 
And the shadow stretched, the lights went out. 


Mother, you sent me to piano lessons 
And praised my arabesques and trills 
Although each teacher found my touch 
Oddly wooden in spite of scales 
And the hours of practicing, my ear 
Tone-deaf and yes, unteachable. 
I learned, I learned, I learned elsewhere, 
From muses unhired by you, dear mother. 


I woke one day to see you, mother, 
Floating above me in bluest air 


75 


1957 

On a green balloon bright with a million 
Flowers and bluebirds that never were 
Never, never, found anywhere. 
But the little planet bobbed away 
Like a soap-bubble as you called: Come here! 
And I faced my traveling companions. 


Day now, night now, at head, side, feet, 
They stand their vigil in gowns of stone, 
Faces blank as the day I was born, 
Their shadows long in the setting sun 
That never brightens or goes down. 
And this is the kingdom you bore me to, 
Mother, mother. But no frown of mine 
Will betray the company I keep. 


6/ Night Shift 

It was not a heart, beating, 
That muted boom, that clangor 
Far off, not blood in the ears 
Drumming up any fever 


To impose on the evening. 
The noise came from outside: 
A metal detonating 
Native, evidently, to 


These stilled suburbs: nobody 
Startled at it, though the sound 
Shook the ground with its pounding. 
It took root at my coming 


Till the thudding source, exposed, 
Confounded inept guesswork: 
Framed in windows of Main Street's 
Silver factory, immense 


Hammers hoisted, wheels turning, 
Stalled, let fall their vertical 


76 


1957 


Tonnage of metal and wood; 
Stunned the marrow. Men in white 


Undershirts circled, tending 
Without stop those greased machines, 
Tending, without stop, the blunt 
Indefatigable fact. 


62 Ouija 

It is a chilly god, a god of shades, 
Rises to the glass from his black fathoms. 
At the window, those unborn, those undone 
Assemble with the frail paleness of moths, 
An envious phosphorescence in their wings. 
Vermilions, bronzes, colors of the sun 
In the coal fire will not wholly console them. 
Imagine their deep hunger, deep as the dark 
For the blood-heat that would ruddle or reclaim. 
The glass mouth sucks blood-heat from my forefinger. 
The old god dribbles, in return, his words. 


The old god, too, writes aureate poetry 
In tarnished modes, maundering among the wastes, 
Fair chronicler of every foul declension. 
Age, and ages of prose, have uncoiled 
His talking whirlwind, abated his excessive temper 
When words, like locusts, drummed the darkening air 
And left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean. 
Skies once wearing a blue, divine hauteur 
Ravel above us, mistily descend, 
Thickening with motes, to a marriage with the mire. 


He hymns the rotten queen with saffron hair 
Who has saltier aphrodisiacs 
Than virgins' tears. That bawdy queen of death, 
Her wormy couriers are at his bones. 
Still he hymns juice of her, hot nectarine. 
I see him, horny-skinned and tough, construe 
What flinty pebbles the ploughblade upturns 
As ponderable tokens of her love. 


77 



J957 

He, godly, doddering, spells 
No succinct Gabriel from the letters here 
But floridly, his amorous nostalgias. 

 On the Decline of Oracles 

My father kept a vaulted conch 
By two bronze bookends of ships in sail, 
And as I listened its cold teeth seethed 
With voices of that ambiguous sea 
Old Bocklin missed, who held a shell 
To hear the sea he could not hear. 
What the seashell spoke to his inner ear 
He knew, but no peasants know. 


My father died, and when he died 
He willed his books and shell away. 
The books burned up, sea took the shell, 
But I, I keep the voices he 
Set in my ear, and in my eye 
The sight of those blue, unseen waves 
For which the ghost of Bocklin grieves. 
The peasants feast and multiply. 


Eclipsing the spitted ox I see 
Neither brazen swan nor burning star, 
Heraldry of a starker age, 
But three men entering the yard, 
And those men coming up the stair. 
Profitless, their gossiping images 
Invade the cloistral eye like pages 
From a gross comic strip, and toward 


The happening of this happening 
The earth turns now. In half an hour 
I shall go down the shabby stair and meet, 
Coming up, those three. Worth 
Less than present, past-this future. 
Worthless such vision to eyes gone dull 
That once descried Troy's towers fall, 
Saw evil break out of the north.

 Snakecharmer 

As the gods began one world, and man another, 
So the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere 
With moon-eye, mouth-pipe. He pipes. Pipes green. Pipes water. 


Pipes water green until green waters waver 
With reedy lengths and necks and undulatings. 
And as his notes twine green, the green river 


Shapes its images around his songs. 
He pipes a place to stand on, but no rocks, 
No floor: a wave of flickering grass tongues 


Supports his foot. He pipes a world of snakes, 
Of sways and coilings, from the snake-rooted bottom 
Of his mind. And now nothing but snakes 


Is visible. The snake-scales have become 
Leaf, become eyelid; snake-bodies, bough, breast 
Of tree and human. And he within this snakedom 


Rules the writhings which make manifest 
His snakehood and his might with pliant tunes 
From his thin pipe. Out of this green nest 


As out of Eden's navel twist the lines 
Of snaky generations: let there be snakes! 
And snakes there were, are, will be-till yawns 


Consume this piper and he tires of music 
And pipes the world back to the simple fabric 
Of snake-warp, snake-weft. Pipes the cloth of snakes 


To a melting of green waters, till no snake 
Shows its head, and those green waters back to 
Water, to green, to nothing like a snake. 
Puts up his pipe, and lids his moony eye.

 A Lesson in Vengeance 

In the dour ages 
Of drafty cells and draftier castles, 
Of dragons breathing without the frame of fables, 
Saint and king unfisted obstruction's knuckles 
By no miracle or majestic means, 


But by such abuses 
As smack of spite and the overscrupulous 
Twisting of thumbscrews: one soul tied in sinews, 
One white horse drowned, and all the unconquered pinnacles 
Of God's city and Babylon's 


Must wait, while here Suso's 
Hand hones his tacks and needles, 
Scourging to sores his own red sluices 
For the relish of heaven, relentless, dousing with prickles 
Of horsehair and lice his horny loins; 


While there irate Cyrus 
Squanders a summer and the brawn of his heroes 
To rebuke the horse-swallowing River Gyndes: 
He split it into three hundred and sixty trickles 
A girl could wade without wetting her shins. 


Still, latter-day sages, 
Smiling at this behavior, subjugating their enemies 
Neatly, nicely, by disbelief or bridges, 
Never grip, as their grandsires did, that devil who chuckles 
From grain of the marrow and the river-bed grains.

 Virgin in a Tree 

How this tart fable instructs 
And mocks! Here's the parody of that moral mousetrap 
Set in the proverbs stitched on samplers 
Approving chased girls who get them to a tree 
And put on bark's nun-black 


Habit which deflects 
All amorous arrows. For to sheathe the virgin shape 
In a scabbard of wood baffles pursuers, 
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first Daphne 
Switched her incomparable back 

For a bay-tree hide, respect's 
Twined to her hard limbs like ivy: the puritan lip 
Cries: 'Celebrate Syrinx whose demurs 
Won her the frog-colored skin, pale pith and watery 
Bed of a reed. Look: 


Pine-needle armor protects 
Pitys from Pan's assault! And though age drop 
Their leafy crowns, their fame soars, 
Eclipsing Eva, Cleo and Helen of Troy: 
For which of those would speak 


For a fashion that constricts 
White bodies in a wooden girdle, root to top 
Unfaced, unformed, the nipple-flowers 
Shrouded to suckle darkness ? Only they 
Who keep cool and holy make 


81 


'958 

A sanctum to attract 
Green virgins, consecrating limb and lip 
To chastity's service: like prophets, like preachers, 
They descant on the serene and seraphic beauty 
Of virgins for virginity's sake.' 


Be certain some such pact's 
Been struck to keep all glory in the grip 
Of ugly spinsters and barren sirs 
As you etch on the inner window of your eye 
This virgin on her rack: 


She, ripe and unplucked, 's 
Lain splayed too long in the tortuous boughs: overripe 
Now, dour-faced, her fingers 
Stiff as twigs, her body woodenly 
Askew, she'll ache and wake 


Though doomsday bud. Neglect's 
Given her lips that lemon-tasting droop: 
Untongued, all beauty's bright juice sours. 
Tree-twist will ape this gross anatomy 
Till irony's bough break. 


 Perseus 

The Triumph of Wit Over Suffering 

Head alone shows you in the prodigious act 
Of digesting what centuries alone digest: 
The mammoth, lumbering statuary of sorrow, 
Indissoluble enough to riddle the guts 
Of a whale with holes and holes, and bleed him white 
Into salt seas. Hercules had a simple time, 
Rinsing those stables: a baby's tears would do it. 
But who'd volunteer to gulp the Laocoon, 
The Dying Gaul and those innumerable pietas 
Festering on the dim walls of Europe's chapels, 
Museums and sepulchers? You.

You 
Who borrowed feathers for your feet, not lead, 
Not nails, and a mirror to keep the snaky head 
In safe perspective, could outface the gorgon-grimace 
Of human agony: a look to numb 
Limbs: not a basilisk-blink, nor a double whammy, 
But all the accumulated last grunts, groans, 
Cries and heroic couplets concluding the million 
Enacted tragedies on these blood-soaked boards, 
And every private twinge a hissing asp 
To petrify your eyes, and every village 
Catastrophe a writhing length of cobra, 
And the decline of empires the thick coil of a vast 
Anaconda. 

Imagine: the world 
Fisted to a foetus head, ravined, seamed 
With suffering from conception upwards, and there 
You have it in hand. Grit in the eye or a sore 
Thumb can make anyone wince, but the whole globe 
Expressive of grief turns gods, like kings, to rocks. 
Those rocks, cleft and worn, themselves then grow 
Ponderous and extend despair on earth's 
Dark face. 

So might rigor mortis come to stiffen 
All creation, were it not for a bigger belly 
Still than swallows joy. 

You enter now, 
Armed with feathers to tickle as well as fly, 
And a fun-house mirror that turns the tragic muse 
To the beheaded head of a sullen doll, one braid, 
A bedraggled snake, hanging limp as the absurd mouth 
Hangs in its lugubrious pout. Where are 
The classic limbs of stubborn Antigone ? 
The red, royal robes of Phedre? The tear-dazzled 
Sorrows of Malfi's gentle duchess ? 

Gone 
In the deep convulsion gripping your face, muscles 
And sinews bunched, victorious, as the cosmic 
Laugh does away with the unstitching, plaguey wounds 
Of an eternal sufferer.

From the Comic Operatic Fantasy The Seafarer 

It beguiles - 
This little Odyssey 
In pink and lavender 
Over a surface of gently-
Graded turquoise tiles 
That represent a sea 
With chequered waves and gaily 
Bear up the seafarer, 
Gaily, gaily, 
In his pink plume and armor. 


A lantern-frail 
Gondola of paper 
Ferries the fishpond Sindbad 
Who poises his pastel spear 
Toward three pinky-purple 
Monsters which uprear 
Off the ocean-floor 
With fanged and dreadful head. 
Beware, beware 
The whale, the shark, the squid. 


But fins and scales 
Of each scrolled sea-beast 
Troll no slime, no weed. 
They are polished for the joust, 
They gleam like easter eggshells, 
Rose and amethyst. 
Ahab, fulfill your boast: 
Bring home each storied head. 
One thrust, one thrust, 
One thrust: and they are sped.

And so all children sing 
Their bathtub battles deep,

For pasteboard, and siren-song 
For fever in a sleep. 
Laughing, laughing 
Of graybeards wakes us up. 


 Yadwigha, on a Red Couch, 
Among Lilies 
A Sestina for the Douanier 


Yadwigha, the literalists once wondered how you 
Came to be lying on this baroque couch 
Upholstered in red velvet, under the eye 
Of uncaged tigers and a tropical moon, 
Set in an intricate wilderness of green 
Heart-shaped leaves, like catalpa leaves, and lilies 


Of monstrous size, like no well-bred lilies. 
It seems the consistent critics wanted you 
To choose between your world of jungle green 
And the fashionable monde of the red couch 
With its prim bric-a-brac, without a moon 
To turn you luminous, without the eye 


Of tigers to be stilled by your dark eye 
And body whiter than its frill of lilies: 
They'd have had yellow silk screening the moon, 
Leaves and lilies flattened to paper behind you 
Or, at most, to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the couch 
Stood stubborn in its jungle: red against green, 


Red against fifty variants of green, 
The couch glared out at the prosaic eye. 


85 


'958 

So Rousseau, to explain why the red couch 
Persisted in the picture with the lilies, 
Tigers, snakes, and the snakecharmer and you, 
And birds of paradise, and the round moon, 


Described how you fell dreaming at full of moon 
On a red velvet couch within your green-
Tessellated boudoir. Hearing flutes, you 
Dreamed yourself away in the moon's eye 
To a beryl jungle, and dreamed that bright moon-lilies 
Nodded their petaled heads around your couch. 


And that, Rousseau told the critics, was why the couch 
Accompanied you. So they nodded at the couch with the moon 
And the snakecharmer's song and the gigantic lilies, 
Marvelingly numbered the many shades of green. 
But to a friend, in private, Rousseau confessed his eye 
So possessed by the glowing red of the couch which you, 


Yadwigha, pose on, that he put you on the couch 
To feed his eye with red: such red! under the moon, 
In the midst of all that green and those great lilies!

Still, they're our best mustering of height: by 
Comparison with the sunken silver-grizzled 
Back of the Connecticut, the river-level 
Flats of Hadley farms, they're lofty enough 
Elevations to be called something more than hills. 
Green, wholly green, they stand their knobby spine 
Against our sky: they are what we look southward to 
Up Pleasant Street at Main. Poising their shapes 
Between the snuff and red tar-paper apartments, 
They mound a summer coolness in our view. 

To people who live in the bottom of valleys 
A rise in the landscape, hummock or hogback, looks 
To be meant for climbing. A peculiar logic 
In going up for the coming down if the post 
We start at's the same post we finish by, 
But it's the clear conversion at the top can hold 
Us to the oblique road, in spite of a fitful 
Wish for even ground, and it's the last cliff 
Ledge will dislodge our cramped concept of space, unwall 
Horizons beyond vision, spill vision 
After the horizons, stretching the narrowed eye 
To full capacity. We climb in hopes 
Of such seeing up the leaf-shuttered escarpments, 
Blindered by green, under a green-grained sky 

Into the blue. Tops define themselves as places 
Where nothing higher's to be looked to. Downward looks 
Follow the black arrow-backs of swifts on their track 
Of the air eddies' loop and arc though air's at rest 
To us, since we see no leaf edge stir high 
Here on a mount overlaid with leaves. The paint-peeled 
Hundred-year-old hotel sustains its ramshackle 
Four-way veranda, view-keeping above 
The fallen timbers of its once remarkable 
Funicular railway, witness to gone 
Time, and to graces gone with the time. A state view-

Of state scenery, sells soda, shows off viewpoints.

As roses broach their carmine in a mirror. Flux 
Of the desultory currents-all that unique 
Stipple of shifting wave-tips is ironed out, lost 
In the simplified orderings of sky-
Lorded perspectives. Maplike, the far fields are ruled 
By correct green lines and no seedy free-for-all 
Of asparagus heads. Cars run their suave 
Colored beads on the strung roads, and the people stroll 
Straightforwardly across the springing green. 
All's peace and discipline down there. Till lately we 
Lived under the shadow of hot rooftops 
And never saw how coolly we might move. For once 
A high hush quietens the crickets' cry.

Back then, the sun 
Didn't go down in such a hurry. How it

Lay over the leaves like a clear cellophane, 
A pane of dragonfly wing, when they left me 
With a hundred bushel baskets on the edge 
Of the spinach patch. 


Bunch after bunch of green 
Upstanding spinach-tips wedged in a circle- 
Layer on layer, and you had a basket 
Irreproachable as any lettuce head, 
Pure leafage. A hundred baskets by day's end. 


Sun and sky mirrored the green of the spinach. 
In the tin pail shaded by yellow paper 
Well-water kept cool at the start of the rows. 
The water had an iron taste, and the air, 
Even, a tang of metal.

The Ghost's Leavetaking 

Enter the chilly no-man's land of about 
Five o'clock in the morning, the no-color void 
Where the waking head rubbishes out the draggled lot 
Of sulfurous dreamscapes and obscure lunar conundrums 
Which seemed, when dreamed, to mean so profoundly much, 


Gets ready to face the ready-made creation 
Of chairs and bureaus and sleep-twisted sheets. 
This is the kingdom of the fading apparition, 
The oracular ghost who dwindles on pin-legs 
To a knot of laundry, with a classic bunch of sheets 


Upraised, as a hand, emblematic of farewell. 
At this joint between two worlds and two entirely 
Incompatible modes of time, the raw material 
Of our meat-and-potato thoughts assumes the nimbus 
Of ambrosial revelation. And so departs. 


Chair and bureau are the hieroglyphs 
Of some godly utterance wakened heads ignore: 
So these posed sheets, before they thin to nothing, 
Speak in sign language of a lost otherworld, 
A world we lose by merely waking up. 


Trailing its telltale tatters only at the outermost 
Fringe of mundane vision, this ghost goes 
Hand aloft, goodbye, goodbye, not down 
Into the rocky gizzard of the earth, 
But toward a region where our thick atmosphere 


90 


'958 


Diminishes, and God knows what is there. 
A point of exclamation marks that sky 
In ringing orange like a stellar carrot. 
Its round period, displaced and green, 
Suspends beside it the first point, the starting 


Point of Eden, next the new moon's curve. 
Go, ghost of our mother and father, ghost of us, 
And ghost of our dreams' children, in those sheets 
Which signify our origin and end, 
To the cloud-cuckoo land of color wheels 


And pristine alphabets and cows that moo 
And moo as they jump over moons as new 
As that crisp cusp towards which you voyage now. 
Hail and farewell. Hello, goodbye. O keeper 
Of the profane grail, the dreaming skull.

But sure stations in bronze, wood, stone.

Inane worlds of wind and cloud.

Old man, you surface seldom. 

Then you come in with the tide's coming 

When seas wash cold, foam-

Capped : white hair, white beard, far-flung, 

A dragnet, rising, falling, as waves 

Crest and trough. Miles long 

Extend the radial sheaves 
Of your spread hair, in which wrinkling skeins 
Knotted, caught, survives 

The old myth of origins 
Unimaginable. You float near 
As keeled ice-mountains 

Of the north, to be steered clear 

Of, not fathomed. All obscurity 

Starts with a danger: 

Your dangers are many. I 

Cannot look much but your form suffers 

Some strange injury 

92 


'958 


And seems to die: so vapors 
Ravel to clearness on the dawn sea. 
The muddy rumors 


Of your burial move me 
To half-believe: your reappearance 
Proves rumors shallow, 


For the archaic trenched lines 
Of your grained face shed time in runnels: 
Ages beat like rains 


On the unbeaten channels 
Of the ocean. Such sage humor and 
Durance are whirlpools 


To make away with the ground-
Work of the earth and the sky's ridgepole. 
Waist down, you may wind 


One labyrinthine tangle 
To root deep among knuckles, shinbones, 
Skulls. Inscrutable, 


Below shoulders not once 
Seen by any man who kept his head, 
You defy questions; 


You defy other godhood. 
I walk dry on your kingdom's border 
Exiled to no good. 


Your shelled bed I remember. 
Father, this thick air is murderous. 
I would breathe water.

It is no night to drown in: 
A full moon, river lapsing 
Black beneath bland mirror-sheen, 


The blue water-mists dropping 
Scrim after scrim like fishnets 
Though fishermen are sleeping, 


The massive castle turrets 
Doubling themselves in a glass 
All stillness. Yet these shapes float 


Up toward me, troubling the face 
Of quiet. From the nadir 
They rise, their limbs ponderous 


With richness, hair heavier 
Than sculpted marble. They sing 
Of a world more full and clear 


Than can be. Sisters, your song 
Bears a burden too weighty 
For the whorled ear's listening 


Here, in a well-steered country, 
Under a balanced ruler. 
Deranging by harmony 


Beyond the mundane order, 
Your voices lay siege. You lodge 
On the pitched reefs of nightmare, 


Promising sure harborage; 
By day, descant from borders 
Of hebetude, from the ledge 


Also of high windows. Worse 
Even than your maddening 
Song, your silence. At the source 


94 


'958 

Of your ice-hearted calling- 
Drunkenness of the great depths. 
O river, I see drifting 


Deep in your flux of silver 
Those great goddesses of peace. 
Stone, stone, ferry me down there. 


Mussel Hunter at Rock Harbor 

I came before the water-
Colorists came to get the 
Good of the Cape light that scours 
Sand grit to sided crystal 
And buffs and sleeks the blunt hulls 
Of the three fishing smacks beached 
On the bank of the river's 

Backtracking tail. I'd come for 
Free fish-bait: the blue mussels 
Clumped like bulbs at the grass-root 
Margin of the tidal pools. 
Dawn tide stood dead low. I smelt 
Mud stench, shell guts, gulls' leavings; 
Heard a queer crusty scrabble 

Cease, and I neared the silenced 
Edge of a cratered pool-bed 
The mussels hung dull blue and 
Conspicuous, yet it seemed 
A sly world's hinges had swung 
Shut against me. All held still. 
Though I counted scant seconds, 

Enough ages lapsed to win 
Confidence of safe-conduct 

95 


'958 

In the wary otherworld 
Eyeing me. Grass put forth claws; 
Small mud knobs, nudged from under, 
Displaced their domes as tiny 
Knights might doff their casques. The crabs 

Inched from their pigmy burrows 
And from the trench-dug mud, all 
Camouflaged in mottled mail 
Of browns and greens. Each wore one 
Claw swollen to a shield large 
As itself-no fiddler's arm 
Grown Gargantuan by trade, 

But grown grimly, and grimly 
Borne, for a use beyond my 
Guessing of it. Sibilant 
Mass-motived hordes, they sidled 
Out in a converging stream 
Toward the pool-mouth, perhaps to 
Meet the thin and sluggish thread 

Of sea retracing its tide-
Way up the river-basin. 
Or to avoid me. They moved 
Obliquely with a dry-wet 
Sound, with a glittery wisp 
And trickle. Could they feel mud 
Pleasurable under claws 

As I could between bare toes ? 
That question ended it-I 
Stood shut out, for once, for all, 
Puzzling the passage of their 
Absolutely alien 
Order as I might puzzle 
At the clear tail of Halley's 

Comet coolly giving my 
Orbit the go-by, made known 
By a family name it 

96 


'958 

Knew nothing of. So the crabs 
Went about their business, which 
Wasn't fiddling, and I filled 
A big handkerchief with blue 

Mussels. From what the crabs saw, 
If they could see, I was one 
Two-legged mussel-picker. 
High on the airy thatching 
Of the dense grasses I found 
The husk of a fiddler-crab, 
Intact, strangely strayed above 

His world of mud-green color 
And innards bleached and blown off 
Somewhere by much sun and wind; 
There was no telling if he'd 
Died recluse or suicide 
Or headstrong Columbus crab. 
The crab-face, etched and set there, 

Grimaced as skulls grimace: it 
Had an Oriental look, 
A samurai death mask done 
On a tiger tooth, less for 
Art's sake than God's. Far from sea - 
Where red-freckled crab-backs, claws 
And whole crabs, dead, their soggy 

Bellies pallid and upturned, 
Perform their shambling waltzes 
On the waves' dissolving turn 
And return, losing themselves 
Bit by bit to their friendly 
Element-this relic saved 
Face, to face the bald-faced sun.

Grub-white mulberries redden among leaves. 
I'll go out and sit in white like they do, 
Doing nothing. July's juice rounds their nubs. 


This park is fleshed with idiot petals. 
White catalpa flowers tower, topple, 
Cast a round white shadow in their dying. 


A pigeon rudders down. Its fan-tail's white. 
Vocation enough: opening, shutting 
White petals, white fan-tails, ten white fingers. 


Enough for fingernails to make half-moons 
Redden in white palms no labor reddens. 
White bruises toward color, else collapses. 


Berries redden. A body of whiteness 
Rots, and smells of rot under its headstone 
Though the body walk out in clean linen. 


I smell that whiteness here, beneath the stones 
Where small ants roll their eggs, where grubs fatten. 
Death may whiten in sun or out of it. 


Death whitens in the egg and out of it. 
I can see no color for this whiteness. 
White: it is a complexion of the mind. 


I tire, imagining white Niagaras 
Build up from a rock root, as fountains build 
Against the weighty image of their fall.

Frog Autumn 

Summer grows old, cold-blooded mother. 
The insects are scant, skinny. 
In these palustral homes we only 
Croak and wither. 


Mornings dissipate in somnolence. 
The sun brightens tardily 
Among the pithless reeds. Flies fail us. 
The fen sickens. 


Frost drops even the spider. Clearly 
The genius of plenitude 
Houses himself elsewhere. Our folk thin 
Lamentably. 


In Midas' Country 

Meadows of gold dust. The silver 
Currents of the Connecticut fan 
And meander in bland pleatings under 
River-verge farms where rye-heads whiten. 
All's polished to a dull luster 


In the sulfurous noon. We move 
With the languor of idols below 
The sky's great bell glass and briefly engrave 
Our limbs' image on a field of straw 
And goldenrod as on gold leaf. 


It might be heaven, this static 
Plenitude: apples gold on the bough, 
Goldfinch, goldfish, golden tiger cat stock-
Still in one gigantic tapestry - 
And lovers affable, dovelike. 


But now the water-skiers race, 
Bracing their knees. On unseen towlines 


99 



1958 


They cleave the river's greening patinas; 
The mirror quivers to smithereens. 
They stunt like clowns in the circus. 


So we are hauled, though we would stop 
On this amber bank where grasses bleach. 
Already the farmer's after his crop, 
August gives over its Midas touch, 
Wind bares a flintier landscape. 


Incommunicado 

The groundhog on the mountain did not run 
But fatly scuttled into the splayed fern 
And faced me, back to a ledge of dirt, to rattle 
Her sallow rodent teeth like castanets 
Against my leaning down, would not exchange 
For that wary clatter sound or gesture 
Of love: claws braced, at bay, my currency not hers. 


Such meetings never occur in marchen 
Where love-met groundhogs love one in return, 
Where straight talk is the rule, whether warm or hostile, 
Which no gruff animal misinterprets. 
From what grace am I fallen. Tongues are strange, 
Signs say nothing. The falcon who spoke clear 
To Canacee cries gibberish to coarsened ears. 


Child's Park Stones 

In sunless air, under pines 
Green to the point of blackness, some 
Founding father set these lobed, warped stones 
To loom in the leaf-filtered gloom 
Black as the charred knuckle-bones 

ioo 


'958 

Of a giant or extinct 
Animal, come from another 
Age, another planet surely. Flanked 
By the orange and fuchsia bonfire 
Of azaleas, sacrosanct 

These stones guard a dark repose 
And keep their shapes intact while sun 
Alters shadows of rose and iris - 
Long, short, long-in the lit garden 
And kindles a day's-end blaze 

Colored to dull the pigment 
Of the azaleas, yet burnt out 
Quick as they. To follow the light's tint 
And intensity by midnight 
By noon and throughout the brunt 

Of various weathers is 
To know the still heart of the stcnes: 
Stones that take the whole summer to lose 
Their dream of the winter's cold; stones 
Warming at core only as 

Frost forms. No man's crowbar could 
Uproot them: their beards are ever-
Green. Nor do they, once in a hundred 
Years, go down to drink the river : 
No thirst disturbs a stone's bed.

Clocks belled twelve. Main Street showed otherwise 
Than its suburb of woods: nimbus-

Of wedding pastries, 

Diamond rings, potted roses, fox-skins 
Ruddy on the wax mannequins

In a glassed tableau of affluence. 
From deep-sunk basements 

What moved the pale, raptorial owl 
Then, to squall above the level 
Of streetlights and wires, its wall to wall 
Wingspread in control 

Of the ferrying currents, belly 
Dense-feathered, fearfully soft to 
Look upon ? Rats' teeth gut the city 
Shaken by owl cry.

 Whiteness I Remember 

Whiteness being what I remember 
About Sam: whiteness and the great run 
He gave me. I've gone nowhere since but 
Going's been tame deviation. White, 
Not of heraldic stallions: ofF-white 
Of the stable horse whose history's 
Humdrum, unexceptionable, his 
Tried sobriety hiring him out 
To novices and to the timid. 
Yet the dapple toning his white down 
To safe gray never grayed his temper. 

I see him one-tracked, stubborn, white horse, 
First horse under me, high as the roofs, 
His neat trot pitching my tense poise up, 
Unsettling the steady-rooted green 
Of country hedgerows and cow pastures 
To a giddy jog. Then for ill will 
Or to try me he suddenly set 
Green grass streaming, houses a river 
Of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard road 
An anvil, hooves four hammers to jolt 
Me off into their space of beating, 

102 


'958 

Stirrups undone, and decorum. And 
Wouldn't slow for the hauled reins, his name, 
Or shouts of walkers: crossroad traffic 
Stalling curbside at his oncoming, 
The world subdued to his run of it. 
I hung on his neck. Resoluteness 
Simplified me: a rider, riding 
Hung out over hazard, over hooves 
Loud on earth's bedrock. Almost thrown, not 
Thrown: fear, wisdom, at one: all colors 
Spinning to still in his one whiteness.

85 Fable of the Rhododendron Stealers 

I walked the unwalked garden of rose-beds 
In the public park; at home felt the want 
Of a single rose present to imagine 
The garden's remainder in full paint. 


The stone lion-head set in the wall 
Let drop its spittle of sluggish green 
Into the stone basin. I snipped 
An orange bud, pocketed it. When 


It had opened its orange in my vase, 
Retrogressed to blowze, I next chose red; 
Argued my conscience clear which robbed 
The park of less red than withering did. 


Musk satisfied my nose, red my eye, 
The petals' nap my fingertips: 
I considered the poetry I rescued 
From blind air, from complete eclipse. 


Yet today, a yellow bud in my hand, 
I stalled at sudden noisy crashes 
From the laurel thicket. No one approached. 
A spasm took the rhododendron bushes: 


103 


1958 


Three girls, engrossed, were wrenching full clusters 
Of cerise and pink from the rhododendron, 
Mountaining them on spread newspaper. 
They brassily picked, slowed by no chagrin, 


And wouldn't pause for my straight look. 
But gave me pause, my rose a charge, 
Whether nicety stood confounded by love, 
Or petty thievery by large. 


The Death of Myth-Making 

Two virtues ride, by stallion, by nag, 

To grind our knives and scissors: 
Lantern-jawed Reason, squat Common Sense, 
One courting doctors of all sorts, 

One, housewives and shopkeepers. 

The trees are lopped, the poodles trim, 

The laborer's nails pared level 
Since those two civil servants set 
Their whetstone to the blunted edge 

And minced the muddling devil 

Whose owl-eyes in the scraggly wood 

Scared mothers to miscarry, 
Drove the dogs to cringe and whine, 
And turned the farmboy's temper wolfish, 

The housewife's, desultory. 

Green Rock, Winthrop Bay 

No lame excuses can gloss over 
Barge-tar clotted at the tide-line, the wrecked pier 
I should have known better. 

104 


'958 

Fifteen years between me and the bay 
Profited memory, but did away with the old scenery 
And patched this shoddy 


Makeshift of a view to quit 
My promise of an idyll, the blue's worn out: 
It's a niggard estate, 


Inimical now. The great green rock 
We gave good use as ship and house is black 
With tarry muck 


And periwinkles, shrunk to common 
Size. The cries of scavenging gulls sound thin 
In the traffic of planes 


From Logan Airport opposite. 
Gulls circle gray under shadow of a steelier flight. 
Loss cancels profit. 


Unless you do this tawdry harbor 
A service and ignore it, I go a liar 
Gilding what's eyesore, 


Or must take loophole and blame time 
For the rock's dwarfed lump, for the drabbled scum, 
For a churlish welcome. 


 The Companionable Ills 

The nose-end that twitches, the old imperfections- 
Tolerable now as moles on the face 
Put up with until chagrin gives place 
To a wry complaisance - 


Dug in first as God's spurs 
To start the spirit out of the mud 
It stabled in; long-used, became well-loved 
Bedfellows of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.

I Want, I Want 

Open-mouthed, the baby god 
Immense, bald, though baby-headed, 
Cried out for the mother's dug. 
The dry volcanoes cracked and spit, 


Sand abraded the milkless lip. 
Cried then for the father's blood 
Who set wasp, wolf and shark to work, 
Engineered the gannet's beak. 


Dry-eyed, the inveterate patriarch 
Raised his men of skin and bone, 
Barbs on the crown of gilded wire, 
Thorns on the bloody rose-stem. 


Poems, Potatoes 

The word, defining, muzzles; the drawn line 
Ousts mistier peers and thrives, murderous, 
In establishments which imagined lines 


Can only haunt. Sturdy as potatoes, 
Stones, without conscience, word and line endure, 
Given an inch. Not that they're gross (although 


Afterthought often would have them alter 
To delicacy, to poise) but that they 
Shortchange me continuously: whether 


More or other, they still dissatisfy. 
Unpoemed, unpictured, the potato 
Bunches its knobby browns on a vastly 
Superior page; the blunt stone also.

The Times Are Tidy 

Unlucky the hero born 
In this province of the stuck record 
Where the most watchful cooks go jobless 
And the mayor's rotisserie turns 
Round of its own accord. 


There's no career in the venture 
Of riding against the lizard, 
Himself withered these latter-days 
To leaf-size from lack of action: 
History's beaten the hazard. 


The last crone got burnt up 
More than eight decades back 
With the love-hot herb, the talking cat, 
But the children are better for it, 
The cow milks cream an inch thick.

The Bull of Bendylaw 

The black bull bellowed before the sea. 
The sea, till that day orderly, 
Hove up against Bendylaw. 


The queen in the mulberry arbor stared 
Stiff as a queen on a playing card. 
The king fingered his beard. 


A blue sea, four horny bull-feet, 
A bull-snouted sea that wouldn't stay put, 
Bucked at the garden gate. 


Along box-lined walks in the florid sun 
Toward the rowdy bellow and back again 
The lords and ladies ran. 


The great bronze gate began to crack, 
The sea broke in at every crack, 
Pellmell, blueblack. 


The bull surged up, the bull surged down, 
Not to be stayed by a daisy chain 
Nor by any learned man. 


O the king's tidy acre is under the sea, 
And the royal rose in the bull's belly, 
And the bull on the king's highway.

The Eye-mote 

Blameless as daylight I stood looking 
At a field of horses, necks bent, manes blown, 
Tails streaming against the green 
Backdrop of sycamores. Sun was striking 
While chapel pinnacles over the roofs, 
Holding the horses, the clouds, the leaves 


Steadily rooted though they were all flowing 
Away to the left like reeds in a sea 
When the splinter flew in and stuck my eye, 
Needling it dark. Then I was seeing 
A melding of shapes in a hot rain: 
Horses warped on the altering green, 


Outlandish as double-humped camels or unicorns, 
Grazing at the margins of a bad monochrome, 
Beasts of oasis, a better time. 
Abrading my lid, the small grain burns: 
Red cinder around which I myself, 
Horses, planets and spires revolve. 


Neither tears nor the easing flush 
Of eyebaths can unseat the speck: 
It sticks, and it has stuck a week. 
I wear the present itch for flesh, 
Blind to what will be and what was. 
I dream that I am Oedipus. 


What I want back is what I was 
Before the bed, before the knife, 
Before the brooch-pin and the salve 
Fixed me in this parenthesis; 
Horses fluent in the wind, 
A place, a time gone out of mind.

Point Shirley 

From Water-Tower Hill to the brick prison 
The shingle booms, bickering under 
The sea's collapse. 
Snowcakes break and welter. This year 
The gritted wave leaps 
The seawall and drops onto a bier 
Of quahog chips, 
Leaving a salty mash of ice to whiten 


In my grandmother's sand yard. She is dead, 
Whose laundry snapped and froze here, who 
Kept house against 
What the sluttish, rutted sea could do. 
Squall waves once danced 
Ship timbers in through the cellar window; 
A thresh-tailed, lanced 
Shark littered in the geranium bed - 


Such collusion of mulish elements 
She wore her broom straws to the nub. 
Twenty years out 
Of her hand, the house still hugs in each drab 
Stucco socket 
The purple egg-stones: from Great Head's knob 
To the filled-in Gut 
The sea in its cold gizzard ground those rounds. 


Nobody wintering now behind 
The planked-up windows where she set 
Her wheat loaves 
And apple cakes to cool. What is it 
Survives, grieves 
So, over this battered, obstinate spit 
Of gravel ? The waves' 
Spewed relics clicker masses in the wind, 


Grey waves the stub-necked eiders ride. 
A labor of love, and that labor lost. 
Steadily the sea 


no 


1959 


Eats at Point Shirley. She died blessed, 
And I come by 
Bones, bones only, pawed and tossed, 
A dog-faced sea. 
The sun sinks under Boston, bloody red. 


I would get from these dry-papped stones 
The milk your love instilled in them. 
The black ducks dive. 
And though your graciousness might stream, 
And I contrive, 
Grandmother, stones are nothing of home 
To that spumiest dove. 
Against both bar and tower the black sea runs. 


Goatsucker 

Old goatherds swear how all night long they hear 
The warning whirr and burring of the bird 
Who wakes with darkness and till dawn works hard 
Vampiring dry of milk each great goat udder. 
Moon full, moon dark, the chary dairy farmer 
Dreams that his fattest cattle dwindle, fevered 
By claw-cuts of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird, 
Its eye, flashlit, a chip of ruby fire. 


So fablis say the Goatsucker moves, masked from men's sight 
In an ebony air, on wings of witch cloth, 
Well-named, ill-famed a knavish fly-by-night, 
Yet it never milked any goat, nor dealt cow death 
And shadows only-cave-mouth bristle beset- 
Cockchafers and the wan, green luna moth.

Stilled, silvered as water in a glass 
Nothing is big or far.

The small shrew chitters from its wilderness 
Of grassheads and is heard. 
Each thumb-size bird 
Flits nimble-winged in thickets, and of good color. 


Cloudwrack and owl-hollowed willows slanting over 
The bland Granta double their white and green 
World under the sheer water 
And ride that flux at anchor, upside down. 
The punter sinks his pole. 
In Byron's pool 
Cat-tails part where the tame cygnets steer. 


It is a country on a nursery plate. 
Spotted cows revolve their jaws and crop 
Red clover or gnaw beetroot 
Bellied on a nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup. 
Hedging meadows of benign 
Arcadian green 
The blood-berried hawthorn hides its spines with white. 


Droll, vegetarian, the water rat 
Saws down a reed and swims from his limber grove, 
While the students stroll or sit, 
Hands laced, in a moony indolence of love- 
Black-gowned, but unaware 
How in such mild air 
The owl shall stoop from his turret, the rat cry out.

 A Winter Ship 

At this wharf there are no grand landings to speak of. 
Red and orange barges list and blister 
Shackled to the dock, outmoded, gaudy, 
And apparently indestructible. 
The sea pulses under a skin of oil.

A gull holds his pose on a shanty ridgepole, 
Riding the tide of the wind, steady 
As wood and formal, in a jacket of ashes, 
The whole flat harbor anchored in 
The round of his yellow eye-button. 


A blimp swims up like a day-moon or tin 
Cigar over his rink of fishes. 
The prospect is dull as an old etching. 
They are unloading three barrels of little crabs. 
The pier pilings seem about to collapse 


And with them that rickety edifice 
Of warehouses, derricks, smokestacks and bridges 
In the distance. All around us the water slips 
And gossips in its loose vernacular, 
Ferrying the smells of dead cod and tar. 


Farther out, the waves will be mouthing icecakes- 
A poor month for park-sleepers and lovers. 
Even our shadows are blue with cold. 
We wanted to see the sun come up 
And are met, instead, by this iceribbed ship, 


Bearded and blown, an albatross of frost, 
Relic of tough weather, every winch and stay 
Encased in a glassy pellicle. 
The sun will diminish it soon enough: 
Each wave-tip glitters like a knife. 


 Aftermath 

Compelled by calamity's magnet 
They loiter and stare as if the house 
Burnt-out were theirs, or as if they thought 
Some scandal might any minute ooze 
From a smoke-choked closet into light; 
No deaths, no prodigious injuries 
Glut these hunters after an old meat, 
Blood-spoor of the austere tragedies.

Mother Medea in a green smock 
Moves humbly as any housewife through 
Her ruined apartments, taking stock 
Of charred shoes, the sodden upholstery: 
Cheated of the pyre and the rack, 
The crowd sucks her last tear and turns away. 


Two Views of a Cadaver Room 

(i) 
The day she visited the dissecting room 
They had four men laid out, black as burnt turkey, 
Already half unstrung. A vinegary fume 
Of the death vats clung to them; 
The white-smocked boys started working. 
The head of his cadaver had caved in, 
And she could scarcely make out anything 
In that rubble of skull plates and old leather. 
A sallow piece of string held it together. 


In their jars the snail-nosed babies moon and glow. 
He hands her the cut-out heart like a cracked heirloom. 


(2) 
In Brueghel's panorama of smoke and slaughter 
Two people only are blind to the carrion army: 
He, afloat in the sea of her blue satin 
Skirts, sings in the direction 
Of her bare shoulder, while she bends, 
Fingering a leaflet of music, over him, 
Both of them deaf to the fiddle in the hands 
Of the death's-head shadowing their song. 
These Flemish lovers flourish; not for long. 


Yet desolation, stalled in paint, spares the little country 
Foolish, delicate, in the lower right hand corner.

 Suicide off Egg Rock 

Behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled 
On the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats, 
Gas tanks, factory stacks-that landscape 
Of imperfections his bowels were part of- 
Rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught. 
Sun struck the water like a damnation. 
No pit of shadow to crawl into, 
And his blood beating the old tattoo 
I am, I am, I am. Children 
Were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift 
Raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave. 
A mongrel working his legs to a gallop 
Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit. 


He smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold, 
His body beached with the sea's garbage, 
A machine to breathe and beat forever. 
Flies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole 
Buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber. 
The words in his book wormed off the pages. 
Everything glittered like blank paper. 


Everything shrank in the sun's corrosive 
Ray but Egg Rock on the blue wastage. 
He heard when he walked into the water 


The forgetful surf creaming on those ledges. 


101 The Ravaged Face 

Outlandish as a circus, the ravaged face 
Parades the marketplace, lurid and stricken 
By some unutterable chagrin, 
Maudlin from leaky eye to swollen nose. 
Two pinlegs stagger underneath the mass. 
Grievously purpled, mouth skewered on a groan, 
Past keeping to the house, past all discretion - 
Myself, myself!-obscene, lugubrious.

Better the flat leer of the idiot, 
The stone face of the man who doesn't feel, 
The velvet dodges of the hypocrite: 
Better, better, and more acceptable 
To timorous children, to the lady on the street. 
O Oedipus. O Christ. You use me ill.

Metaphors 

I'm a riddle in nine syllables, 
An elephant, a ponderous house, 
A melon strolling on two tendrils. 
O red fruit, ivory, fine timbers! 
This loafs big with its yeasty rising. 
Money's new-minted in this fat purse. 
I'm a means, a stage, a cow in calf. 
I've eaten a bag of green apples, 
Boarded the train there's no getting off.

Electra on Azalea Path 

The day you died I went into the dirt, 
Into the lightless hibernaculum 
Where bees, striped black and gold, sleep out the blizzard 
Like hieratic stones, and the ground is hard. 
It was good for twenty years, that wintering- 
As if you had never existed, as if I came 
God-fathered into the world from my mother's belly: 
Her wide bed wore the stain of divinity. 
I had nothing to do with guilt or anything 
When I wormed back under my mother's heart. 


Small as a doll in my dress of innocence 
I lay dreaming your epic, image by image. 
Nobody died or withered on that stage. 


116 


1959 


Everything took place in a durable whiteness. 
The day I woke, I woke on Churchyard Hill. 
I found your name, I found your bones and all 
Enlisted in a cramped necropolis, 
Your speckled stone askew by an iron fence. 


In this charity ward, this poorhouse, where the dead 
Crowd foot to foot, head to head, no flower 
Breaks the soil. This is Azalea Path. 
A field of burdock opens to the south. 
Six feet of yellow gravel cover you. 
The artificial red sage does not stir 
In the basket of plastic evergreens they put 
At the headstone next to yours, nor does it rot, 
Although the rains dissolve a bloody dye: 
The ersatz petals drip, and they drip red. 


Another kind of redness bothers me: 


The day your slack sail drank my sister's breath 
The flat sea purpled like that evil cloth 
My mother unrolled at your last homecoming. 

I borrow the stilts of an old tragedy. 
The truth is, one late October, at my birth-cry 
A scorpion stung its head, an ill-starred thing; 
My mother dreamed you face down in the sea. 


The stony actors poise and pause for breath. 
I brought my love to bear, and then you died. 
It was the gangrene ate you to the bone 
My mother said; you died like any man. 
How shall I age into that state of mind ? 
I am the ghost of an infamous suicide, 
My own blue razor rusting in my throat. 
O pardon the one who knocks for pardon at 
Your gate, father-your hound-bitch, daughter, friend. 
It was my love that did us both to death.

The Beekeeper's Daughter 


A garden of mouthings. Purple, scarlet-speckled, black 
The great corollas dilate, peeling back their silks. 
Their musk encroaches, circle after circle, 
A well of scents almost too dense to breathe in. 
Hieratical in your frock coat, maestro of the bees, 
You move among the many-breasted hives, 


My heart under your foot, sister of a stone. 


Trumpet-throats open to the beaks of birds. 
The Golden Rain Tree drips its powders down. 
In these little boudoirs streaked with orange and red 
The anthers nod their heads, potent as kings 
To father dynasties. The air is rich. 
Here is a queenship no mother can contest- 


A fruit that's death to taste: dark flesh, dark parings. 


In burrows narrow as a finger, solitary bees 
Keep house among the grasses. Kneeling down 
I set my eye to a hole-mouth and meet an eye 
Round, green, disconsolate as a tear. 
Father, bridegroom, in this Easter egg 
Under the coronal of sugar roses 


The queen bee marries the winter of your year. 


The Hermit at Outermost House 

Sky and sea, horizon-hinged 
Tablets of blank blue, couldn't, 
Clapped shut, flatten this man out. 


The great gods, Stone-Head, Claw-Foot, 
Winded by much rock-bumping 
And claw-threat, realized that.

For what, then, had they endured 
Dourly the long hots and colds, 
Those old despots, if he sat 


Laugh-shaken on his doorsill, 
Backbone unbendable as 
Timbers of his upright hut? 


Hard gods were there, nothing else. 
Still he thumbed out something else. 
Thumbed no stony, horny pot, 


But a certain meaning green. 
He withstood them, that hermit. 
Rock-face, crab-claw verged on green. 


Gulls mulled in the greenest light. 


Man in Black 

Where the three magenta 
Breakwaters take the shove 
And suck of the gray sea 

To the left, and the wave 
Unfists against the dun 
Barb-wired headland of 


The Deer Island prison 
With its trim piggeries, 
Hen huts and cattle green 

To the right, and March ice 
Glazes the rock pools yet, 
Snuff-colored sand cliffs rise 

Over a great stone spit 
Bared by each falling tide, 
And you, across those white 

119 


1959 

Stones, strode out in your dead 
Black coat, black shoes, and your 
Black hair till there you stood, 

Fixed vortex on the far 
Tip, riveting stones, air, 
All of it, together. 


Old Ladies' Home 

Sharded in black, like beetles, 
Frail as antique earthenware 
One breath might shiver to bits, 
The old women creep out here 
To sun on the rocks or prop 
Themselves up against the wall 
Whose stones keep a little heat. 


Needles knit in a bird-beaked 
Counterpoint to their voices: 
Sons, daughters, daughters and sons, 
Distant and cold as photos, 
Grandchildren nobody knows. 
Age wears the best black fabric 
Rust-red or green as lichens. 


At owl-call the old ghosts flock 
To hustle them off the lawn. 
From beds boxed-in like coffins 
The bonneted ladies grin. 
And Death, that bald-head buzzard, 
Stalls in halls where the lamp wick 
Shortens with each breath drawn.

The Net-Menders 


Halfway up from the little harbor of sardine boats, 
Halfway down from groves where the thin, bitter almond pips 
Fatten in green-pocked pods, the three net-menders sit out, 
Dressed in black, everybody in mourning for someone. 
They set their stout chairs back to the road and face the dark 
Dominoes of their doorways. 


Sun grains their crow-colors, 
Purples the fig in the leafs shadow, turns the dust pink. 
On the road named for Tomas Ortunio, mica 
Winks like money under the ringed toes of the chickens. 
The houses are white as sea-salt goats lick from the rocks. 

While their fingers work with the coarse mesh and the fine 
Their eyes revolve the whole town like a blue and green ball. 
Nobody dies or is born without their knowing it. 
They talk of bride-lace, of lovers spunky as gamecocks. 


The moon leans, a stone madonna, over the lead sea 
And the iron hills that enclose them. Earthen fingers 
Twist old words into the web-threads: 


Tonight may the fish 
Be a harvest of silver in the nets, and the lamps 
Of our husbands and sons move sure among the low stars. 

Magnolia Shoals 

Up here among the gull cries 
we stroll through a maze of pale 
red-mottled relics, shells, claws 

as if it were summer still. 
That season has turned its back. 
Though the green sea gardens stall,

bow, and recover their look 
of the imperishable 
gardens in an antique book 


or tapestries on a wall, 
leaves behind us warp and lapse. 
The late month withers, as well. 

Below us a white gull keeps 
the weed-slicked shelf for his own, 
hustles other gulls off. Crabs 

rove over his field of stone; 
mussels cluster blue as grapes: 
his beak brings the harvest in. 

The watercolorist grips 
his brush in the stringent air. 
The horizon's bare of ships, 

the beach and the rocks are bare. 
He paints a blizzard of gulls, 
wings drumming in the winter.

no The Sleepers 

No map traces the street 
Where those two sleepers are. 
We have lost track of it. 
They lie as if under water 
In a blue, unchanging light, 
The French window ajar 


Curtained with yellow lace. 
Through the narrow crack 
Odors of wet earth rise. 
The snail leaves a silver track; 


122 


1959 

Dark thickets hedge the house. 
We take a backward look. 


Among petals pale as death 
And leaves steadfast in shape 
They sleep on, mouth to mouth. 
A white mist is going up. 
The small green nostrils breathe, 
And they turn in their sleep. 


Ousted from that warm bed 
We are a dream they dream. 
Their eyelids keep the shade. 
No harm can come to them. 
We cast our skins and slide 
Into another time.

Air, and blur. 


The red tomato's in, the green bean; 
The cook lugs a pumpkin 
From the vine 


For pies. The fir tree's thick with grackles. 
Gold carp loom in the pools. 
A wasp crawls 


Over windfalls to sip cider-juice. 
Guests in the studios 
Muse, compose. 


Indoors, Tiffany's phoenix rises 
Above the fireplace; 
Two carved sleighs 


123 


1959 


Rest on orange plush near the newel post. 
Wood stoves burn warm as toast. 
The late guest 


Wakens, mornings, to a cobalt sky, 
A diamond-paned window, 
Zinc-white snow. 


Medallion 

By the gate with star and moon 
Worked into the peeled orange wood 
The bronze snake lay in the sun 

Inert as a shoelace; dead 
But pliable still, his jaw 
Unhinged and his grin crooked, 


Tongue a rose-colored arrow. 
Over my hand I hung him. 
His little vermilion eye 


Ignited with a glassed flame 
As I turned him in the light; 
When I split a rock one time 


The garnet bits burned like that. 
Dust dulled his back to ochre 
The way sun ruins a trout. 


Yet his belly kept its fire 
Going under the chainmail, 
The old jewels smoldering there 


In each opaque belly-scale: 
Sunset looked at through milk glass. 
And I saw white maggots coil 


124 


1959 

Thin as pins in the dark bruise 
Where his innards bulged as if 
He were digesting a mouse. 

Knifelike, he was chaste enough, 
Pure death's-metal. The yardman's 
Flung brick perfected his laugh. 

The Manor Garden 

The fountains are dry and the roses over. 
Incense of death. Your day approaches. 
The pears fatten like little buddhas. 
A blue mist is dragging the lake. 


You move through the era of fishes, 
The smug centuries of the pig- 
Head, toe and finger 
Come clear of the shadow. History 


Nourishes these broken flutings, 
These crowns of acanthus, 
And the crow settles her garments. 
You inherit white heather, a bee's wing, 


Two suicides, the family wolves, 
Hours of blankness. Some hard stars 
Already yellow the heavens. 
The spider on its own string 


Crosses the lake. The worms 
Quit their usual habitations. 
The small birds converge, converge 
With their gifts to a difficult borning.

U4 Blue Moles 

d) 

They're out of the dark's ragbag, these two 
Moles dead in the pebbled rut, 
Shapeless as flung gloves, a few feet apart- 
Blue suede a dog or fox has chewed. 
One, by himself, seemed pitiable enough, 
Little victim unearthed by some large creature 
From his orbit under the elm root. 
The second carcass makes a duel of the affair: 
Blind twins bitten by bad nature. 


The sky's far dome is sane and clear. 
Leaves, undoing their yellow caves 
Between the road and the lake water, 
Bare no sinister spaces. Already 
The moles look neutral as the stones. 
Their corkscrew noses, their white hands 
Uplifted, stiffen in a family pose. 
Difficult to imagine how fury struck - 
Dissolved now, smoke of an old war. 


(2) 
Nightly the battle-shouts start up 
In the ear of the veteran, and again 
I enter the soft pelt of the mole. 
Light's death to them: they shrivel in it. 
They move through their mute rooms while I sleep, 
Palming the earth aside, grubbers 
After the fat children of root and rock. 
By day, only the topsoil heaves. 
Down there one is alone. 


Outsize hands prepare a path, 
They go before: opening the veins, 
Delving for the appendages 
Of beetles, sweetbreads, shards-to be eaten 


126 


1959 


Over and over. And still the heaven 
Of final surfeit is just as far 
From the door as ever. What happens between 
Happens in darkness, vanishes 
Easy and often as each breath. 

Dark Wood, Dark Water 

This wood burns a dark 
Incense. Pale moss drips 
In elbow-scarves, beards 

From the archaic 
Bones of the great trees. 
Blue mists move over 

A lake thick with fish. 
Snails scroll the border 
Of the glazed water 

With coils of ram's-horn. 
Out in the open 
Down there the late year 

Hammers her rare and 
Various metals. 
Old pewter roots twist 

Up from the jet-backed 
Mirror of water 
And while the air's clear 

Hourglass sifts a 
Drift of goldpieces 
Bright waterlights are 

Sliding their quoits one 
After the other 
Down boles of the fir.

Polly's Tree 

A dream tree, Polly's tree: 
a thicket of sticks, 
each speckled twig 

ending in a thin-paned 
leaf unlike any 
other on it 

or in a ghost flower 
flat as paper and 
of a color 

vaporish as frost-breath, 
more finical than 
any silk fan 

the Chinese ladies use 
to stir robin's egg 
air. The silver-
haired seed of the milkweed 
comes to roost there, frail 
as the halo 

rayed round a candle flame, 
a will-o'-the-wisp 
nimbus, or puff 

of cloud-stuff", tipping her 
queer candelabrum. 
Palely lit by 

snuff-ruffed dandelions, 
white daisy wheels and 
a tiger-faced 

pansy, it glows. O it's 
no family tree, 
Polly's tree, nor 

128 


1959 


a tree of heaven, though 
it marry quartz-flake, 
feather and rose. 

It sprang from her pillow 
whole as a cobweb, 
ribbed like a hand, 

a dream tree. Polly's tree 
wears a valentine 
arc of tear-pearled 

bleeding hearts on its sleeve 
and, crowning it, one 
blue larkspur star. 

The Colossus 

I shall never get you put together entirely, 
Pieced, glued, and properly jointed. 
Mule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles 
Proceed from your great lips. 
It's worse than a barnyard. 


Perhaps you consider yourself an oracle, 
Mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other. 
Thirty years now I have labored 
To dredge the silt from your throat. 
I am none the wiser. 


Scaling little ladders with gluepots and pails of Lysol 
I crawl like an ant in mourning 
Over the weedy acres of your brow 
To mend the immense skull-plates and clear 
The bald, white tumuli of your eyes. 


A blue sky out of the Oresteia 
Arches above us. O father, all by yourself 
You are pithy and historical as the Roman Forum. 


129 


1959 


I open my lunch on a hill of black cypress. 
Your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered 


In their old anarchy to the horizon-line. 
It would take more than a lightning-stroke 
To create such a ruin. 
Nights, I squat in the cornucopia 
Of your left ear, out of the wind, 


Counting the red stars and those of plum-color. 
The sun rises under the pillar of your tongue. 
My hours are married to shadow. 
No longer do I listen for the scrape of a keel 
On the blank stones of the landing. 


Private Ground 

First frost, and I walk among the rose-fruit, the marble toes 
Of the Greek beauties you brought 
Off Europe's relic heap 
To sweeten your neck of the New York woods. 
Soon each white lady will be boarded up 
Against the cracking climate. 


All morning, with smoking breath, the handyman 
Has been draining the goldfish ponds. 
They collapse like lungs, the escaped water 
Threading back, filament by filament, to the pure 
Platonic table where it lives. The baby carp 
Litter the mud like orangepeel. 


Eleven weeks, and I know your estate so well 
I need hardly go out at all. 
A superhighway seals me off. 
Trading their poisons, the north and south bound cars 
Flatten the doped snakes to ribbon. In here, the grasses 
Unload their griefs on my shoes, 


130 


1959 


The woods creak and ache, and the day forgets itself. 
I bend over this drained basin where the small fish 
Flex as the mud freezes. 
They glitter like eyes, and I collect them all. 
Morgue of old logs and old images, the lake 
Opens and shuts, accepting them among its reflections. 


Poem for a Birthday 

/. Who 

The month of flowering's finished. The fruit's in, 
Eaten or rotten. I am all mouth. 
October's the month for storage. 


This shed's fusty as a mummy's stomach: 
Old tools, handles and rusty tusks. 
I am at home here among the dead heads. 


Let me sit in a flowerpot, 
The spiders won't notice. 
My heart is a stopped geranium. 


If only the wind would leave my lungs alone. 
Dogbody noses the petals. They bloom upside down. 
They rattle like hydrangea bushes. 


Moldering heads console me, 
Nailed to the rafters yesterday: 
Inmates who don't hibernate. 


Cabbageheads: wormy purple, silver-glaze, 
A dressing of mule ears, mothy pelts, but green-hearted, 
Their veins white as porkfat. 


O the beauty of usage! 
The orange pumpkins have no eyes. 
These halls are full of women who think they are birds. 


131 


1959 


This is a dull school. 
I am a root, a stone, an owl pellet, 
Without dreams of any sort. 


Mother, you are the one mouth 
I would be a tongue to. Mother of otherness 
Eat me. Wastebasket gaper, shadow of doorway. 


I said: I must remember this, being small. 
There were such enormous flowers, 
Purple and red mouths, utterly lovely. 


The hoops of blackberry stems made me cry. 
Now they light me up like an electric bulb. 
For weeks I can remember nothing at all. 


2. Dark House 
This is a dark house, very big. 
I made it myself, 
Cell by cell from a quiet corner, 
Chewing at the gray paper, 
Oozing the glue drops, 
Whistling, wiggling my ears, 
Thinking of something else. 


It has so many cellars, 
Such eelish delvings! 
I am round as an owl, 
I see by my own light. 
Any day I may litter puppies 
Or mother a horse. My belly moves. 
I must make more maps. 


These marrowy tunnels! 
Moley-handed, I eat my way. 
All-mouth licks up the bushes 
And the pots of meat. 
He lives in an old well, 
A stony hole. He's to blame. 
He's a fat sort. 


132 


1959 

Pebble smells, turnipy chambers. 
Small nostrils are breathing. 
Little humble loves! 
Footlings, boneless as noses, 
It is warm and tolerable 
In the bowel of the root. 
Here's a cuddly mother. 


j . Maenad 
Once I was ordinary: 
Sat by my father's bean tree 
Eating the fingers of wisdom. 
The birds made milk. 
When it thundered I hid under a flat stone. 


The mother of mouths didn't love me. 
The old man shrank to a doll. 
0 I am too big to go backward: 
Birdmilk is feathers, 
The bean leaves are dumb as hands. 


This month is fit for little. 
The dead ripen in the grapeleaves. 
A red tongue is among us. 
Mother, keep out of my barnyard, 
1 am becoming another. 


Dog-head, devourer: 
Feed me the berries of dark. 
The lids won't shut. Time 
Unwinds from the great umbilicus of the sun 
Its endless glitter. 


I must swallow it all. 


Lady, who are these others in the moon's vat- 
Sleepdrunk, their limbs at odds ? 
In this light the blood is black. 
Tell me my name.

q. The Beast 
He was bullman earlier, 
King of the dish, my lucky animal. 
Breathing was easy in his airy holding. 
The sun sat in his armpit. 
Nothing went moldy. The little invisibles 
Waited on him hand and foot. 
The blue sisters sent me to another school. 
Monkey lived under the dunce cap. 
He kept blowing me kisses. 
I hardly knew him. 


He won't be got rid of: 
Mumblepaws, teary and sorry, 
Fido Littlesoul, the bowel's familiar. 
A dustbin's enough for him. 
The dark's his bone. 
Call him any name, he'll come to it. 


Mud-sump, happy sty-face. 
I've married a cupboard of rubbish. 
I bed in a fish puddle. 
Down here the sky is always falling. 
Hogwallow's at the window. 
The star bugs won't save me this month. 
I housekeep in Time's gut-end 
Among emmets and mollusks, 
Duchess of Nothing, 
Hairtusk's bride. 


5. Flute Notes from a Reedy Pond 
Now coldness comes sifting down, layer after layer, 
To our bower at the lily root. 
Overhead the old umbrellas of summer 
Wither like pithless hands. There is little shelter. 


Hourly the eye of the sky enlarges its blank 
Dominion. The stars are no nearer. 
Already frog-mouth and fish-mouth drink 
The liquor of indolence, and all things sink 


134 


1959 


Into a soft caul of forgetfulness. 
The fugitive colors die. 
Caddis worms drowse in their silk cases, 
The lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep like statues. 


Puppets, loosed from the strings of the puppet-master, 
Wear masks of horn to bed. 
This is not death, it is something safer. 
The wingy myths won't tug at us any more: 


The molts are tongueless that sang from above the water 
Of golgotha at the tip of a reed, 
And how a god flimsy as a baby's finger 
Shall unhusk himself and steer into the air. 


6. Witch Burning 
In the marketplace they are piling the dry sticks. 
A thicket of shadows is a poor coat. I inhabit 
The wax image of myself, a doll's body. 
Sickness begins here: I am a dartboard for witches. 
Only the devil can eat the devil out. 
In the month of red leaves I climb to a bed of fire. 


It is easy to blame the dark: the mouth of a door, 
The cellar's belly. They've blown my sparkler out. 
A black-sharded lady keeps me in a parrot cage. 
What large eyes the dead have! 
I am intimate with a hairy spirit. 
Smoke wheels from the beak of this empty jar. 


If I am a little one, I can do no harm. 
If I don't move about, I'll knock nothing over. So I said, 
Sitting under a potlid, tiny and inert as a rice grain. 
They are turning the burners up, ring after ring. 
We are full of starch, my small white fellows. We grow. 
It hurts at first. The red tongues will teach the truth. 


Mother of beetles, only unclench your hand: 
I'll fly through the candle's mouth like a singeless moth. 


^55 



1959 


Give me back my shape. I am ready to construe the days 
I coupled with dust in the shadow of a stone. 
My ankles brighten. Brightness ascends my thighs. 
I am lost, I am lost, in the robes of all this light. 


7. The Stones 
This is the city where men are mended. 
I lie on a great anvil. 
The flat blue sky-circle 


Flew off like the hat of a doll 
When I fell out of the light. I entered 
The stomach of indifference, the wordless cupboard. 


The mother of pestles diminished me. 
I became a still pebble. 
The stones of the belly were peaceable, 


The head-stone quiet, jostled by nothing. 
Only the mouth-hole piped out, 
Importunate cricket 


In a quarry of silences. 
The people of the city heard it. 
They hunted the stones, taciturn and separate, 


The mouth-hole crying their locations. 
Drunk as a foetus 
I suck at the paps of darkness. 


The food tubes embrace me. Sponges kiss my lichens away. 
The jewelmaster drives his chisel to pry 
Open one stone eye. 


This is the after-hell: I see the light. 
A wind unstoppers the chamber 
Of the ear, old worrier. 


136 


1959 


Water mollifies the flint lip, 
And daylight lays its sameness on the wall. 
The grafters are cheerful, 


Heating the pincers, hoisting the delicate hammers. 
A current agitates the wires 
Volt upon volt. Catgut stitches my fissures. 


A workman walks by carrying a pink torso. 
The storerooms are full of hearts. 
This is the city of spare parts. 


My swaddled legs and arms smell sweet as rubber. 
Here they can doctor heads, or any limb. 
On Fridays the little children come 


To trade their hooks for hands. 
Dead men leave eyes for others. 
Love is the uniform of my bald nurse. 


Love is the bone and sinew of my curse. 
The vase, reconstructed, houses 
The elusive rose. 


Ten fingers shape a bowl for shadows. 
My mendings itch. There is nothing to do. 
I shall be good as new. 


4 November igS9 

The Burnt-out Spa 

An old beast ended in this place: 

A monster of wood and rusty teeth. 
Fire smelted his eyes to lumps 
Of pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque 
As resin drops oozed from pine bark. 


137 


1959 

The rafters and struts of his body wear 
Their char of karakul still. I can't tell 
How long his carcass has foundered under 
The rubbish of summers, the black-leaved falls. 


Now little weeds insinuate 
Soft suede tongues between his bones. 
His armorplate, his toppled stones 
Are an esplanade for crickets. 


I pick and pry like a doctor or 
Archaeologist among 
Iron entrails, enamel bowls, 
The coils and pipes that made him run. 


The small dell eats what ate it once. 
And yet the ichor of the spring 
Proceeds clear as it ever did 
From the broken throat, the marshy lip. 


It flows off below the green and white 
Balustrade of a sag-backed bridge. 
Leaning over, I encounter one 
Blue and improbable person 


Framed in a basketwork of cat-tails. 
O she is gracious and austere, 
Seated beneath the toneless water! 
It is not I, it is not I. 


No animal spoils on her green doorstep. 
And we shall never enter there 
Where the durable ones keep house. 
The stream that hustles us 


Neither nourishes nor heals.

Whitely, discreetly, 
Very quietly 


Our toes, our noses 
Take hold on the loam, 
Acquire the air. 


Nobody sees us, 
Stops us, betrays us; 
The small grains make room. 


Soft fists insist on 
Heaving the needles, 
The leafy bedding, 


Even the paving. 
Our hammers, our rams, 
Earless and eyeless, 


Perfectly voiceless, 
Widen the crannies, 
Shoulder through holes. We 


Diet on water, 
On crumbs of shadow, 
Bland-mannered, asking 


Little or nothing. 


So many of us! 


So many of us! 


We are shelves, we are 
Tables, we are meek, 
We are edible, 


Nudgers and shovers 
In spite of ourselves.

Clownlike, happiest on your hands, 
Feet to the stars, and moon-skulled, 
Gilled like a fish. A common-sense 
Thumbs-down on the dodo's mode. 
Wrapped up in yourself like a spool, 
Trawling your dark as owls do. 
Mute as a turnip from the Fourth 
Of July to All Fools' Day, 
O high-riser, my little loaf. 


Vague as fog and looked for like mail. 
Farther off than Australia. 
Bent-backed Atlas, our traveled prawn. 
Snug as a bud and at home 
Like a sprat in a pickle jug. 
A creel of eels, all ripples. 
Jumpy as a Mexican bean. 
Right, like a well-done sum. 
A clean slate, with your own face on.

By the roots of my hair some god got hold of me.

A world of bald white days in a shadeless socket.

Stillborn 

These poems do not live: it's a sad diagnosis. 
They grew their toes and fingers well enough, 
Their little foreheads bulged with concentration. 
If they missed out on walking about like people 
It wasn't for any lack of mother-love. 


O I cannot understand what happened to them! 
They are proper in shape and number and every part. 
They sit so nicely in the pickling fluid! 
They smile and smile and smile and smile at me. 
And still the lungs won't fill and the heart won't start. 


They are not pigs, they are not even fish, 
Though they have a piggy and a fishy air- 
It would be better if they were alive, and that's what they were. 
But they are dead, and their mother near dead with distraction, 
And they stupidly stare, and do not speak of her. 


On Deck 

Midnight in the mid-Atlantic. On deck. 
Wrapped up in themselves as in thick veiling 
And mute as mannequins in a dress shop, 
Some few passengers keep track 
Of the old star-map on the ceiling. 
Tiny and far, a single ship 


Lit like a two-tiered wedding cake 
Carries its candles slowly off. 
Now there is nothing much to look at. 
Still nobody will move or speak- 
The bingo players, the players at love 
On a square no bigger than a carpet 


142 


ig6o 

Are hustled over the crests and troughs, 
Each stalled in his particular minute 
And castled in it like a king. 
Small drops spot their coats, their gloves: 
They fly too fast to feel the wet. 
Anything can happen where they are going. 


The untidy lady revivalist 
For whom the good Lord provides (He gave 
Her a pocketbook, a pearl hatpin 
And seven winter coats last August) 
Prays under her breath that she may save 
The art students in West Berlin. 


The astrologer at her elbow (a Leo) 
Picked his trip-date by the stars. 
He is gratified by the absence of icecakes. 
He'll be rich in a year (and he should know) 
Selling the Welsh and English mothers 
Nativities at two-and-six. 


And the white-haired jeweler from Denmark is 


carving 
A perfectly faceted wife to wait 
On him hand and foot, quiet as a diamond. 
Moony balloons tied by a string 
To their owners' wrists, the light dreams float 
To be let loose at news of land. 

July ig6o 

 Sleep in the Mojave Desert 

Out here there are no hearthstones, 
Hot grains, simply. It is dry, dry. 
And the air dangerous. Noonday acts queerly 
On the mind's eye, erecting a line 
Of poplars in the middle distance, the only 
Object beside the mad, straight road 
One can remember men and houses by.

A cool wind should inhabit those leaves 
And a dew collect on them, dearer than money, 
In the blue hour before sunup. 
Yet they recede, untouchable as tomorrow, 
Or those glittery fictions of spilt water 
That glide ahead of the very thirsty. 


I think of the lizards airing their tongues 
In the crevice of an extremely small shadow 
And the toad guarding his heart's droplet. 
The desert is white as a blind man's eye, 
Comfortless as salt. Snake and bird 
Doze behind the old masks of fury. 
We swelter like firedogs in the wind. 
The sun puts its cinder out. Where we lie 
The heat-cracked crickets congregate 
In their black armorplate and cry. 
The day-moon lights up like a sorry mother, 
And the crickets come creeping into our hair 
To fiddle the short night away.

 Two Campers in Cloud Country 

(Rock Lake, Canada) 

In this country there is neither measure nor balance 
To redress the dominance of rocks and woods, 
The passage, say, of these man-shaming clouds. 


No gesture of yours or mine could catch their attention, 
No word make them carry water or fire the kindling 
Like local trolls in the spell of a superior being. 


Well, one wearies of the Public Gardens: one wants a vacatior 
Where trees and clouds and animals pay no notice; 
Away from the labeled elms, the tame tea-roses.

It took three days driving north to find a cloud 
The polite skies over Boston couldn't possibly accommodate. 
Here on the last frontier of the big, brash spirit 

The horizons are too far off to be chummy as uncles; 
The colors assert themselves with a sort of vengeance. 
Each day concludes in a huge splurge of vermilions 


And night arrives in one gigantic step. 
It is comfortable, for a change, to mean so little. 
These rocks offer no purchase to herbage or people: 


They are conceiving a dynasty of perfect cold. 
In a month we'll wonder what plates and forks are for. 
I lean to you, numb as a fossil. Tell me I'm here. 


The Pilgrims and Indians might never have happened. 
Planets pulse in the lake like bright amoebas; 
The pines blot our voices up in their lightest sighs. 


Around our tent the old simplicities sough 
Sleepily as Lethe, trying to get in. 
We'll wake blank-brained as water in the dawn.

 Leaving Early 

Lady, your room is lousy with flowers. 
When you kick me out, that's what I'll remember, 
Me, sitting here bored as a leopard 
In your jungle of wine-bottle lamps, 
Velvet pillows the colour of blood pudding 
And the white china flying fish from Italy. 
I forget you, hearing the cut flowers 
Sipping their liquids from assorted pots, 
Pitchers and Coronation goblets 
Like Monday drunkards. The milky berries 
Bow down, a local constellation,

Toward their admirers in the tabletop: 
Mobs of eyeballs looking up. 
Are those petals or leaves you've paired them with - 
Those green-striped ovals of silver tissue ? 
The red geraniums I know. 
Friends, friends. They stink of armpits 
And the involved maladies of autumn, 
Musky as a lovebed the morning after. 
My nostrils prickle with nostalgia. 
Henna hags: cloth of your cloth. 
They toe old water thick as fog. 


The roses in the toby jug 
Gave up the ghost last night. High time. 
Their yellow corsets were ready to split. 
You snored, and I heard the petals unlatch, 
Tapping and ticking like nervous fingers. 
You should have junked them before they died. 
Daybreak discovered the bureau lid 
Littered with Chinese hands. Now I'm stared at 
By chrysanthemums the size 
Of Holofernes' head, dipped in the same 
Magenta as this fubsy sofa. 
In the mirror their doubles back them up. 
Listen: your tenant mice 
Are rattling the cracker packets. Fine flour 
Muffles their bird-feet: they whistle for joy. 
And you doze on, nose to the wall. 
This mizzle fits me like a sad jacket. 
How did we make it up to your attic ? 
You handed me gin in a glass bud vase. 
We slept like stones. Lady, what am I doing 
With a lung full of dust and a tongue of wood, 
Knee-deep in the cold and swamped byflowers?

 Love Letter 

Not easy to state the change you made. 
If I'm alive now, then I was dead, 
Though, like a stone, unbothered by it, 
Staying put according to habit. 
You didn't just toe me an inch, no - 
Nor leave me to set my small bald eye 
Skyward again, without hope, of course, 
Of apprehending blueness, or stars. 


That wasn't it. I slept, say: a snake 
Masked among black rocks as a black rock 
In the white hiatus of winter- 
Like my neighbors, taking no pleasure 
In the million perfectly-chiseled 
Cheeks alighting each moment to melt 
My cheek of basalt. They turned to tears, 
Angels weeping over dull natures, 
But didn't convince me. Those tears froze. 
Each dead head had a visor of ice. 


And I slept on like a bent finger. 
The first thing I saw was sheer air 
And the locked drops rising in a dew 
Limpid as spirits. Many stones lay 
Dense and expressionless round about. 
I didn't know what to make of it. 
I shone, mica-scaled, and unfolded 
To pour myself out like a fluid 
Among bird feet and the stems of plants. 
I wasn't fooled. I knew you at once. 


Tree and stone glittered, without shadows. 
My finger-length grew lucent as glass. 
I started to bud like a March twig: 
An arm and a leg, an arm, a leg. 
From stone to cloud, so I ascended. 
Now I resemble a sort of god 
Floating through the air in my soul-shift 
Pure as a pane of ice. It's a gift.

Nothing so vulgar as a nose or an eye 
Bossing the ethereal blanks of their face-ovals. 


Their whiteness bears no relation to laundry, 
Snow, chalk or suchlike. They're 
The real thing, all right: the Good, the True- 


Salutary and pure as boiled water, 
Loveless as the multiplication table. 
While the child smiles into thin air. 


Six months in the world, and she is able 
To rock on all fours like a padded hammock. 
For her, the heavy notion of Evil 


Attending her cot is less than a belly ache, 
And Love the mother of milk, no theory.

In its hollow of shadows, its fringe of reeds, 
And the owner past thirty, no beauty at all.

Drag up false, Edwardian sentiments, 
And I remember my maternal grandmother from Vienna. 
As a schoolgirl she gave roses to Franz Josef. 
The burghers sweated and wept. The children wore white. 
And my grandfather moped in the Tyrol, 


Imagining himself a headwaiter in America, 
Floating in a high-church hush 
Among ice buckets, frosty napkins. 
These little globes of light are sweet as pears. 
Kindly with invalids and mawkish women, 


They mollify the bald moon. 
Nun-souled, they burn heavenward and never marry. 
The eyes of the child I nurse are scarcely open. 
In twenty years I shall be retrograde 
As these draughty ephemerids. 


I watch their spilt tears cloud and dull to pearls. 
How shall I tell anything at all 
To this infant still in a birth-drowse ?

Though nobody in there looks up or bothers to answer.

Never trespassing in bad temper: 
Stalling in midair,

Of valentine-faces might please a collector: 
They ring true, like good china.

A woman is dragging her shadow in a circle 
About a bald, hospital saucer.

And appears to have suffered a sort of private blitzkrieg. 
She lives quietly 


With no attachments, like a foetus in a bottle, 
The obsolete house, the sea, flattened to a picture 
She has one too many dimensions to enter. 
Grief and anger, exorcized, 
Leave her alone now.

Winter dawn is the color of metal, 

The trees stiffen into place like burnt nerves. 

All night I have dreamed of destruction, annihilations - 

An assembly-line of cut throats, and you and I 
Inching off in the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green 

Poison of stilled lawns, the little clapboard gravestones, 

Noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the way to the sea resort. 

How the balconies echoed! How the sun lit up 

The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the view! 

Space! Space! The bed linen was giving out entirely. 

Cot legs melted in terrible attitudes, and the nurses - 

Each nurse patched her soul to a wound and disappeared. 

The deathly guests had not been satisfied 

With the rooms, or the smiles, or the beautiful rubber plants, 

Or the sea, hushing their peeled sense like Old Mother Morphia.

Faceless and pale as china 
The round sky goes on minding its business. 
Your absence is inconspicuous; 
Nobody can tell what I lack. 


Gulls have threaded the river's mud bed back 
To this crest of grass. Inland, they argue, 
Settling and stirring like blown paper 
Or the hands of an invalid. The wan 
Sun manages to strike such tin glints 


From the linked ponds that my eyes wince 
And brim; the city melts like sugar. 
A crocodile of small girls 
Knotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms, 
Opens to swallow me. I'm a stone, a stick, 


One child drops a barrette of pink plastic; 
None of them seem to notice. 
Their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off. 
Now silence after silence offers itself. 
The wind stops my breath like a bandage. 


Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudge 
Swaddles roof and tree. 
It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank. 
I suppose it's pointless to think of you at all. 
Already your doll grip lets go.

Brood, rooted in their heaped losses. 
Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat. 
I lose sight of you on your blind journey, 
While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivulets 
Unspool and spend themselves. My mind runs with them, 


Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem. 
The day empties its images 
Like a cup or a room. The moon's crook whitens, 
Thin as the skin seaming a scar. 
Now, on the nursery wall, 


The blue night plants, the little pale blue hill 
In your sister's birthday picture start to glow. 
The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrus 
Light up. Each rabbit-eared 
Blue shrub behind the glass 


Exhales an indigo nimbus, 
A sort of cellophane balloon. 
The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife. 
Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light; 
I enter the lit house.

Beached under the spumy blooms, we lie 
Seasick and fever-dry.

And ugly, my belly a silk stocking 
Where the heads and tails of my sisters decompose.

Out of sheer boredom. Tangled in the sweat-wet sheets 
I remember the bloodied chicks and the quartered rabbits. 


You checked the diet charts and took me to play 
With the boa constrictor in the Fellows' Garden. 
I pretended I was the Tree of Knowledge. 
I entered your bible, I boarded your ark

And the bear-furred, bird-eating spider 
Clambering round its glass box like an eight-fingered hand. 
I can't get it out of my mind 


How our courtship lit the tindery cages - 

Your two-horned rhinoceros opened a mouth 

Dirty as a bootsole and big as a hospital sink 

For my cube of sugar: its bog breath 

Gloved my arm to the elbow.

Skin doesn't have roots, it peels away easy as paper.

Buried in the lambswool of the dead poodle;

Old sock-face, sagged on a darning egg. 
They've trapped her in some laboratory jar.

Nodding and rocking and fingering her thin hair.

I shall never get out of this! There are two of me now: 
This new absolutely white person and the old yellow one, 
And the white person is certainly the superior one. 
She doesn't need food, she is one of the real saints. 
At the beginning I hated her, she had no personality- 
She lay in bed with me like a dead body 
And I was scared, because she was shaped just the way I was 


Only much whiter and unbreakable and with no complaints. 
I couldn't sleep for a week, she was so cold.

I blamed her for everything, but she didn't answer. 
I couldn't understand her stupid behavior! 
When I hit her she held still, like a true pacifist. 
Then I realized what she wanted was for me to love her: 
She began to warm up, and I saw her advantages. 


Without me, she wouldn't exist, so of course she was grateful. 
I gave her a soul, I bloomed out of her as a rose 
Blooms out of a vase of not very valuable porcelain, 
And it was I who attracted everybody's attention, 
Not her whiteness and beauty, as I had at first supposed. 
I patronized her a little, and she lapped it up - 
You could tell almost at once she had a slave mentality. 


I didn't mind her waiting on me, and she adored it. 
In the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun 
From her amazingly white torso, and I couldn't help but notice 
Her tidiness and her calmness and her patience: 
She humored my weakness like the best of nurses, 
Holding my bones in place so they would mend properly. 
In time our relationship grew more intense. 


She stopped fitting me so closely and seemed offish. 
I felt her criticizing me in spite of herself, 
As if my habits offended her in some way. 
She let in the drafts and became more and more absent-minded. 
And my skin itched and flaked away in soft pieces 
Simply because she looked after me so badly. 
Then I saw what the trouble was: she thought she was immortal. 


She wanted to leave me, she thought she was superior, 
And I'd been keeping her in the dark, and she was resentful - 
Wasting her days waiting on a half-corpse! 
And secretly she began to hope I'd die. 
Then she could cover my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely, 
And wear my painted face the way a mummy-case 
Wears the face of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water. 


I wasn't in any position to get rid of her. 
She'd supported me for so long I was quite limp - 
I had even forgotten how to walk or sit, 


i59

So I was careful not to upset her in any way 
Or brag ahead of time how I'd avenge myself. 
Living with her was like living with my own coffin: 
Yet I still depended on her, though I did it regretfully. 


I used to think we might make a go of it together- 
After all, it was a kind of marriage, being so close. 
Now I see it must be one or the other of us. 
She may be a saint, and I may be ugly and hairy, 
But she'll soon find out that that doesn't matter a bit. 
I'm collecting my strength; one day I shall manage without her, 
And she'll perish with emptiness then, and begin to miss me.

The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. 
Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in. 
I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly 
As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. 
I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. 
I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses 
And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons. 


They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff 
Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. 
Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. 
The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, 
They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, 
Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, 
So it is impossible to tell how many there are. 


My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water 
Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. 
They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. 
Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage 
My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,

Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.

Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. 
They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. 
Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley 
I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books 
Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. 
I am a nun now, I have never been so pure. 


I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted 
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. 
How free it is, you have no idea how free 
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, 
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. 
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them 
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet. 


The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. 
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe 
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. 
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. 
They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, 
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color, 
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck. 


Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. 
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me 
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, 
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow 
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, 
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. 
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen. 


Before they came the air was calm enough, 
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. 
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. 
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river 
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. 
They concentrate my attention, that was happy 
Playing and resting without committing itself.

The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. 
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; 
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,

Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. 
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea, 
And comes from a country far away as health.

Attracting my share of Ahs and spectacularly painted, 


Unknowing I must soon unpetal. 


Compared with me, a tree is immortal 


And a flower-head not tall, but more startling, 


And I want the one's longevity and the other's daring. 


Tonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars, 
The trees and flowers have been strewing their cool odors. 
I walk among them, but none of them are noticing. 
Sometimes I think that when I am sleeping 
I must most perfectly resemble them- 
Thoughts gone dim. 
It is more natural to me, lying down. 
Then the sky and I are in open conversation, 
And I shall be useful when I lie down finally: 
Then the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me.

A bonewhite light, like death, behind all things. 
Under the eyes of the stars and the moon's rictus 
He suffers his desert pillow, sleeplessness 
Stretching its fine, irritating sand in all directions. 


Over and over the old, granular movie 
Exposes embarrassments-the mizzling days 
Of childhood and adolescence, sticky with dreams, 
Parental faces on tall stalks, alternately stern and tearful, 
A garden of buggy roses that made him cry. 
His forehead is bumpy as a sack of rocks. 
Memories jostle each other for face-room like obsolete film stars. 


He is immune to pills: red, purple, blue - 
How they lit the tedium of the protracted evening! 
Those sugary planets whose influence won for him 
A life baptized in no-life for a while, 
And the sweet, drugged waking of a forgetful baby. 
Now the pills are worn-out and silly, like classical gods. 
Their poppy-sleepy colors do him no good. 


His head is a little interior of gray mirrors. 
Each gesture flees immediately down an alley 
Of diminishing perspectives, and its significance 
Drains like water out the hole at the far end. 
He lives without privacy in a lidless room, 
The bald slots of his eyes stiffened wide-open 
On the incessant heat-lightning flicker of situations. 


Nightlong, in the granite yard, invisible cats 
Have been howling like women, or damaged instruments. 
Already he can feel daylight, his white disease, 
Creeping up with her hatful of trivial repetitions. 
The city is a map of cheerful twitters now, 
And everywhere people, eyes mica-silver and blank, 
Are riding to work in rows, as if recently brainwashed.

Widow 

Widow. The word consumes itself- 
Body, a sheet of newsprint on the fire 
Levitating a numb minute in the updraft 
Over the scalding, red topography 
That will put her heart out like an only eye. 


Widow. The dead syllable, with its shadow 
Of an echo, exposes the panel in the wall 
Behind which the secret passage lies-stale air, 
Fusty remembrances, the coiled-spring stair 
That opens at the top onto nothing at all. . . . 


Widow. The bitter spider sits 
And sits in the center of her loveless spokes. 
Death is the dress she wears, her hat and collar. 
The moth-face of her husband, moon white and ill, 
Circles her like a prey she'd love to kill 


A second time, to have him near again - 
A paper image to lay against her heart 
The way she laid his letters, till they grew warm 
And seemed to give her warmth, like a live skin. 
But it is she who is paper now, warmed by no one. 


Widow: that great, vacant estate! 
The voice of God is full of draftiness, 
Promising simply the hard stars, the space 
Of immortal blankness between stars 
And no bodies, singing like arrows up to heaven. 


Widow, the compassionate trees bend in, 
The trees of loneliness, the trees of mourning. 
They stand like shadows about the green landscape- 
Or even like black holes cut out of it. 
A widow resembles them, a shadow-thing, 


Hand folding hand, and nothing in between. 
A bodiless soul could pass another soul 
In this clear air and never notice it -

One soul pass through the other, frail as smoke 
And utterly ignorant of the way it took. 


That is the fear she has-the fear 
His soul may beat and be beating at her dull sense 
Like blue Mary's angel, dovelike against a pane 
Blinded to all but the gray, spiritless room 
It looks in on, and must go on looking in on.

Stars Over the Dordogne 

Stars are dropping thick as stones into the twiggy 
Picket of trees whose silhouette is darker 
Than the dark of the sky because it is quite starless. 
The woods are a well. The stars drop silently. 
They seem large, yet they drop, and no gap is visible. 
Nor do they send up fires where they fall 
Or any signal of distress or anxiousness. 
They are eaten immediately by the pines. 


Where I am at home, only the sparsest stars 
Arrive at twilight, and then after some effort. 
And they are wan, dulled by much travelling. 
The smaller and more timid never arrive at all 
But stay, sitting far out, in their own dust. 
They are orphans. I cannot see them. They are lost. 
But tonight they have discovered this river with no trouble, 
They are scrubbed and self-assured as the great planets. 


The Big Dipper is my only familiar. 
I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are 
Hanging shyly under the studded horizon 
Like a child's too-simple mathematical problem. 
Infinite number seems to be the issue up there. 
Or else they are present, and their disguise so bright 
I am overlooking them by looking too hard. 
Perhaps it is the season that is not right. 


165

And what if the sky here is no different, 
And it is my eyes that have been sharpening themselves ? 
Such a luxury of stars would embarrass me. 
The few I am used to are plain and durable; 
I think they would not wish for this dressy backcloth 
Or much company, or the mildness of the south. 
They are too puritan and solitary for that - 
When one of them falls it leaves a space, 


A sense of absence in its old shining place. 
And where I lie now, back to my own dark star, 
I see those constellations in my head, 
Unwarmed by the sweet air of this peach orchard. 
There is too much ease here; these stars treat me too well. 
On this hill, with its view of lit castles, each swung bell 
Is accounting for its cow. I shut my eyes 
And drink the small night chill like news of home. 


The Rival 

If the moon smiled, she would resemble you. 
You leave the same impression 
Of something beautiful, but annihilating. 
Both of you are great light borrowers. 
Her O-mouth grieves at the world; yours is unaffected, 


And your first gift is making stone out of everything. 
I wake to a mausoleum; you are here, 
Ticking your fingers on the marble table, looking for cigarettes, 
Spiteful as a woman, but not so nervous, 
And dying to say something unanswerable. 


The moon, too, abases her subjects, 
But in the daytime she is ridiculous. 
Your dissatisfactions, on the other hand, 
Arrive through the mailslot with loving regularity, 
White and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide.

 Wuthering Heights 

The horizons ring me like faggots, 
Tilted and disparate, and always unstable. 
Touched by a match, they might warm me, 
And their fine lines singe 
The air to orange 
Before the distances they pin evaporate, 
Weighting the pale sky with a solider color. 
But they only dissolve and dissolve 
Like a series of promises, as I step forward. 


There is no life higher than the grasstops 
Or the hearts of sheep, and the wind 
Pours by like destiny, bending 
Everything in one direction. 
I can feel it trying 
To funnel my heat away. 
If I pay the roots of the heather 
Too close attention, they will invite me 
To whiten my bones among them. 


The sheep know where they are, 
Browsing in their dirty wool-clouds, 
Gray as the weather. 
The black slots of their pupils take me in. 
It is like being mailed into space, 
A thin, silly message. 
They stand about in grandmotherly disguise, 
All wig curls and yellow teeth 
And hard, marbly baas. 


I come to wheel ruts, and water 
Limpid as the solitudes

That flee through my fingers. 
Hollow doorsteps go from grass to grass; 
Lintel and sill have unhinged themselves. 
Of people the air only 
Remembers a few odd syllables. 
It rehearses them moaningly: 
Black stone, black stone. 


The sky leans on me, me, the one upright 
Among all horizontals. 
The grass is beating its head distractedly. 
It is too delicate 
For a life in such company; 
Darkness terrifies it. 
Now, in valleys narrow 
And black as purses, the house lights 
Gleam like small change. 


September 1961 

 Blackberrying 

Nobody in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries, 
Blackberries on either side, though on the right mainly, 
A blackberry alley, going down in hooks, and a sea 
Somewhere at the end of it, heaving. Blackberries 
Big as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes 
Ebon in the hedges, fat 
With blue-red juices. These they squander on my fingers. 
I had not asked for such a blood sisterhood; they must love me. 
They accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides. 


Overhead go the choughs in black, cacophonous flocks - 
Bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky. 
Theirs is the only voice, protesting, protesting. 
I do not think the sea will appear at all. 
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if lit from within. 
I come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies, 
Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a Chinese screen. 


168

The honey-feast of the berries has stunned them; they believe in heaven. 
One more hook, and the berries and bushes end. 


The only thing to come now is the sea. 
From between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me, 
Slapping its phantom laundry in my face. 
These hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt. 
I follow the sheep path between them. A last hook brings me 
To the hills' northern face, and the face is orange rock 
That looks out on nothing, nothing but a great space 
Of white and pewter lights, and a din like silversmiths 
Beating and beating at an intractable metal.

ISO Finisterre 

This was the land's end: the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic, 
Cramped on nothing. Black 
Admonitory cliffs, and the sea exploding 
With no bottom, or anything on the other side of it, 
Whitened by the faces of the drowned. 
Now it is only gloomy, a dump of rocks - 
Leftover soldiers from old, messy wars. 
The sea cannons into their ear, but they don't budge. 
Other rocks hide their grudges under the water. 


The cliffs are edged with trefoils, stars and bells 
Such as fingers might embroider, close to death, 
Almost too small for the mists to bother with. 
The mists are part of the ancient paraphernalia - 
Souls, rolled in the doom-noise of the sea. 
They bruise the rocks out of existence, then resurrect them. 
They go up without hope, like sighs. 
I walk among them, and they stuff my mouth with cotton. 
When they free me, I am beaded with tears. 


Our Lady of the Shipwrecked is striding toward the horizon, 
Her marble skirts blown back in two pink wings.

A marble sailor kneels at her foot distractedly, and at his foot 
A peasant woman in black 
Is praying to the monument of the sailor praying. 
Our Lady of the Shipwrecked is three times life size, 
Her lips sweet with divinity. 
She does not hear what the sailor or the peasant is saying- 
She is in love with the beautiful formlessness of the sea. 


Gull-colored laces flap in the sea drafts 
Beside the postcard stalls. 
The peasants anchor them with conches. One is told: 
'These are the pretty trinkets the sea hides, 
Little shells made up into necklaces and toy ladies. 
They do not come from the Bay of the Dead down there, 
But from another place, tropical and blue, 
We have never been to. 
These are our crepes. Eat them before they blow cold.'

151 The Surgeon at 2 a.m. 

The white light is artificial, and hygienic as heaven. 
The microbes cannot survive it. 
They are departing in their transparent garments, turned aside 
From the scalpels and the rubber hands. 
The scalded sheet is a snowfield, frozen and peaceful. 
The body under it is in my hands. 
As usual there is no face. A lump of Chinese white 
With seven holes thumbed in. The soul is another light. 
I have not seen it; it does not fly up. 
Tonight it has receded like a ship's light. 


It is a garden I have to do with-tubers and fruits 
Oozing their jammy substances, 
A mat of roots. My assistants hook them back. 
Stenches and colors assail me. 
This is the lung-tree. 
These orchids are splendid. They spot and coil like snakes.

I am so small 


In comparison to these organs! 


I worm and hack in a purple wilderness. 


The blood is a sunset. I admire it. 
I am up to my elbows in it, red and squeaking. 


Still it seeps up, it is not exhausted. 


So magical! A hot spring 


I must seal off and let fill 


The intricate, blue piping under this pale marble. 


How I admire the Romans- 
Aqueducts, the Baths of Caracalla, the eagle nose! 


The body is a Roman thing. 
It has shut its mouth on the stone pill of repose. 


It is a statue the orderlies are wheeling off. 
I have perfected it. 
I am left with an arm or a leg, 
A set of teeth, or stones 
To rattle in a bottle and take home, 
And tissue in slices-a pathological salami. 
Tonight the parts are entombed in an icebox. 
Tomorrow they will swim 
In vinegar like saints' relics. 
Tomorrow the patient will have a clean, pink plastic limb. 


Over one bed in the ward, a small blue light 
Announces a new soul. The bed is blue. 
Tonight, for this person, blue is a beautiful color. 
The angels of morphia have borne him up. 
He floats an inch from the ceiling, 
Smelling the dawn drafts. 
I walk among sleepers in gauze sarcophagi. 
The red night lights are flat moons. They are dull with blood. 
I am the sun, in my white coat, 
Gray faces, shuttered by drugs, follow me like flowers.

2 Last Words 

I do not want a plain box, I want a sarcophagus 

With tigery stripes, and a face on it 

Round as the moon, to stare up. 

I want to be looking at them when they come 

Picking among the dumb minerals, the roots. 

I see them already-the pale, star-distance faces. 

Now they are nothing, they are not even babies. 

I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the first gods. 

They will wonder if I was important. 

I should sugar and preserve my days like fruit! 

My mirror is clouding over- 

A few more breaths, and it will reflect nothing at all. 

The flowers and the faces whiten to a sheet. 

I do not trust the spirit. It escapes like steam 
In dreams, through mouth-hole or eye-hole. I can't stop it. 
One day it won't come back. Things aren't like that. 
They stay, their little particular lusters 
Warmed by much handling. They almost purr. 
When the soles of my feet grow cold, 
The blue eye of my turquoise will comfort me. 
Let me have my copper cooking pots, let my rouge pots 
Bloom about me like night flowers, with a good smell. 
They will roll me up in bandages, they will store my heart 
Under my feet in a neat parcel. 
I shall hardly know myself. It will be dark, 
And the shine of these small things sweeter than the face of Ishtar.

3 The Moon and the Yew Tree 

This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary. 
The trees of the mind are black. The light is blue. 
The grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if I were God, 
Prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility. 
Fumy, spiritous mists inhabit this place 


172 


ig6i 

Separated from my house by a row of headstones. 
I simply cannot see where there is to get to. 


The moon is no door. It is a face in its own right, 
White as a knuckle and terribly upset. 
It drags the sea after it like a dark crime; it is quiet 
With the O-gape of complete despair. I live here. 
Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky 
Eight great tongues affirming the Resurrection. 
At the end, they soberly bong out their names. 


The yew tree points up. It has a Gothic shape. 
The eyes lift after it and find the moon. 
The moon is my mother. She is not sweet like Mary. 
Her blue garments unloose small bats and owls. 
How I would like to believe in tenderness 
The face of the effigy, gentled by candles, 
Bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes. 


I have fallen a long way. Clouds are flowering 
Blue and mystical over the face of the stars. 
Inside the church, the saints will be all blue, 
Floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews, 
Their hands and faces stiff with holiness. 
The moon sees nothing of this. She is bald and wild. 
And the message of the yew tree is blackness-blackness and silence.

I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions. 
Whatever I see I swallow immediately 
Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike. 
I am not cruel, only truthful- 
The eye of a little god, four-cornered. 
Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall. 
It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long 
I think it is a part of my heart. But it flickers. 
Faces and darkness separate us over and over.

Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me, 
Searching my reaches for what she really is. 
Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon. 
I see her back, and reflect it faithfully. 
She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands. 
I am important to her. She comes and goes. 
Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness. 
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman 
Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.

 The Babysitters 

It is ten years, now, since we rowed to Children's Island. 
The sun flamed straight down that noon on the water off Marblehead. 
That summer we wore black glasses to hide our eyes. 
We were always crying, in our spare rooms, little put-upon sisters, 
In the two huge, white, handsome houses in Swampscott. 
When the sweetheart from England appeared, with her cream skin and 


Yardley cosmetics, 
I had to sleep in the same room with the baby on a too-short cot, 
And the seven-year-old wouldn't go out unless his jersey stripes 
Matched the stripes of his socks. 

O it was richness!-eleven rooms and a yacht 
With a polished mahogany stair to let into the water 
And a cabin boy who could decorate cakes in six-colored frosting. 
But I didn't know how to cook, and babies depressed me. 
Nights, I wrote in my diary spitefully, my fingers red 
With triangular scorch marks from ironing tiny ruchings and puffed 

sleeves. 
When the sporty wife and her doctor husband went on one of their 

cruises 
They left me a borrowed maid named Ellen, 'for protection', 
And a small Dalmatian. 

In your house, the main house, you were better off. 
You had a rose garden and a guest cottage and a model apothecary shop 


174

And a cook and a maid, and knew about the key to the bourbon. 
I remember you playing 'Ja Da' in a pink pique dress 
On the gameroom piano, when the 'big people' were out, 
And the maid smoked and shot pool under a green-shaded lamp. 
The cook had one wall eye and couldn't sleep, she was so nervous. 
On trial, from Ireland, she burned batch after batch of cookies 
Till she was fired. 


0 what has come over us, my sister! 
On that day-off the two of us cried so hard to get 
We lifted a sugared ham and a pineapple from the grownups' icebox 
And rented an old green boat. I rowed. You read 
Aloud, crosslegged on the stern seat, from the Generation of Vipers. 
So we bobbed out to the island. It was deserted - 
A gallery of creaking porches and still interiors, 
Stopped and awful as a photograph of somebody laughing, 
But ten years dead. 


The bold gulls dove as if they owned it all. 
We picked up sticks of driftwood and beat them off, 
Then stepped down the steep beach shelf and into the water. 
We kicked and talked. The thick salt kept us up. 
1 see us floating there yet, inseparable-two cork dolls. 
What keyhole have we slipped through, what door has shut ? 
The shadows of the grasses inched round like hands of a clock, 
And from our opposite continents we wave and call. 
Everything has happened.

Obstacle glass-wrapped and peculiar, 
Glinting and clinking in a saint's falsetto. Only you 
Don't know what to make of the sudden slippiness, 
The blind, white, awful, inaccessible slant. 
There's no getting up it by the words you know. 
No getting up by elephant or wheel or shoe. 
We have only come to look. You are too new 
To want the world in a glass hat. 


 Three Women 

A Poem for Three Voices 

Setting: A Maternity Ward and round about 

FIRST VOICE: 
I am slow as the world. I am very patient, 
Turning through my time, the suns and stars 
Regarding me with attention. 
The moon's concern is more personal: 
She passes and repasses, luminous as a nurse. 
Is she sorry for what will happen ? I do not think so. 
She is simply astonished at fertility. 


When I walk out, I am a great event. 
I do not have to think, or even rehearse. 
What happens in me will happen without attention. 
The pheasant stands on the hill; 
He is arranging his brown feathers. 


176 


ig62 

I cannot help smiling at what it is I know. 
Leaves and petals attend me. I am ready. 


SECOND VOICE: 
When I first saw it, the small red seep, I did not believe it. 
I watched the men walk about me in the office. They were so flat! 
There was something about them like cardboard, and now I had caught it, 
That flat, flat, flatness from which ideas, destructions, 
Bulldozers, guillotines, white chambers of shrieks proceed, 
Endlessly proceed-and the cold angels, the abstractions. 
I sat at my desk in my stockings, my high heels, 


And the man I work for laughed: 'Have you seen something awful ? 
You are so white, suddenly.' And I said nothing. 
I saw death in the bare trees, a deprivation. 
I could not believe it. Is it so difficult 
For the spirit to conceive a face, a mouth ? 
The letters proceed from these black keys, and these black keys proceed 
From my alphabetical fingers, ordering parts, 


Parts, bits, cogs, the shining multiples. 
I am dying as I sit. I lose a dimension. 
Trains roar in my ears, departures, departures! 
The silver track of time empties into the distance, 
The white sky empties of its promise, like a cup. 
These are my feet, these mechanical echoes. 
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am found wanting. 


This is a disease I carry home, this is a death. 
Again, this is a death. Is it the air, 
The particles of destruction I suck up ? Am I a pulse 
That wanes and wanes, facing the cold angel ? 
Is this my lover then ? This death, this death ? 
As a child I loved a lichen-bitten name. 
Is this the one sin then, this old dead love of death ? 


THIRD VOICE: 
I remember the minute when I knew for sure. 
The willows were chilling, 
The face in the pool was beautiful, but not mine- 
It had a consequential look, like everything else, 


177 


ig62 

And all I could see was dangers: doves and words, 
Stars and showers of gold-conceptions, conceptions! 
I remember a white, cold wing 


And the great swan, with its terrible look, 
Coming at me, like a castle, from the top of the river. 
There is a snake in swans. 
He glided by; his eye had a black meaning. 
I saw the world in it-small, mean and black, 
Every little word hooked to every little word, and act to act. 
A hot blue day had budded into something. 


I wasn't ready. The white clouds rearing 
Aside were dragging me in four directions. 
I wasn't ready. 
I had no reverence. 
I thought I could deny the consequence- 
But it was too late for that. It was too late, and the face 
Went on shaping itself with love, as if I was ready. 


SECOND VOICE: 
It is a world of snow now. I am not at home. 
How white these sheets are. The faces have no features. 
They are bald and impossible, like the faces of my children, 
Those little sick ones that elude my arms. 
Other children do not touch me: they are terrible. 
They have too many colors, too much life. They are not quiet, 
Quiet, like the little emptinesses I carry. 


I have had my chances. I have tried and tried. 
I have stitched life into me like a rare organ, 
And walked carefully, precariously, like something rare. 
I have tried not to think too hard. I have tried to be natural. 
I have tried to be blind in love, like other women, 
Blind in my bed, with my dear blind sweet one, 
Not looking, through the thick dark, for the face of another. 


I did not look. But still the face was there, 
The face of the unborn one that loved its perfections, 
The face of the dead one that could only be perfect 
In its easy peace, could only keep holy so. 


178 


ig62 

And then there were other faces. The faces of nations, 
Governments, parliaments, societies, 
The faceless faces of important men. 


It is these men I mind: 
They are so jealous of anything that is not flat! They are jealous gods 
That would have the whole world flat because they are. 
I see the Father conversing with the Son. 
Such flatness cannot but be holy. 
'Let us make a heaven,' they say. 
'Let us flatten and launder the grossness from these souls.' 


FIRST VOICE: 
I am calm. I am calm. It is the calm before something awful: 
The yellow minute before the wind walks, when the leaves 
Turn up their hands, their pallors. It is so quiet here. 
The sheets, the faces, are white and stopped, like clocks. 
Voices stand back and flatten. Their visible hieroglyphs 
Flatten to parchment screens to keep the wind off. 
They paint such secrets in Arabic, Chinese! 


I am dumb and brown. I am a seed about to break. 
The brownness is my dead self, and it is sullen: 
It does not wish to be more, or different. 
Dusk hoods me in blue now, like a Mary. 
0 color of distance and forgetfulness! - 
When will it be, the second when Time breaks 
And eternity engulfs it, and I drown utterly ? 


1 talk to myself, myself only, set apart- 
Swabbed and lurid with disinfectants, sacrificial. 
Waiting lies heavy on my lids. It lies like sleep, 
Like a big sea. Far off, far off, I feel the first wave tug 
Its cargo of agony toward me, inescapable, tidal. 
And I, a shell, echoing on this white beach 
Face the voices that overwhelm, the terrible element. 


THIRD VOICE: 
I am a mountain now, among mountainy women. 
The doctors move among us as if our bigness 
Frightened the mind. They smile like fools.

They are to blame for what I am, and they know it. 
They hug their flatness like a kind of health. 
And what if they found themselves surprised, as I did ? 
They would go mad with it. 


And what if two lives leaked between my thighs ? 
I have seen the white clean chamber with its instruments. 
It is a place of shrieks. It is not happy. 
'This is where you will come when you are ready.' 
The night lights are flat red moons. They are dull with blood. 
I am not ready for anything to happen. 
I should have murdered this, that murders me. 


FIRST VOICE: 
There is no miracle more cruel than this. 
I am dragged by the horses, the iron hooves. 
I last. I last it out. I accomplish a work. 
Dark tunnel, through which hurtle the visitations, 
The visitations, the manifestations, the startled faces. 
I am the center of an atrocity. 
What pains, what sorrows must I be mothering ? 


Can such innocence kill and kill ? It milks my life. 
The trees wither in the street. The rain is corrosive. 
I taste it on my tongue, and the workable horrors, 
The horrors that stand and idle, the slighted godmothers 
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their satchels of instruments. 
I shall be a wall and a roof, protecting. 
I shall be a sky and a hill of good: O let me be! 


A power is growing on me, an old tenacity. 
I am breaking apart like the world. There is this blackness, 
This ram of blackness. I fold my hands on a mountain. 
The air is thick. It is thick with this working. 
I am used. I am drummed into use. 
My eyes are squeezed by this blackness. 
I see nothing. 


SECOND VOICE: 
I am accused. I dream of massacres. 
I am a garden of black and red agonies. I drink them,

Hating myself, hating and fearing. And now the world conceives 
Its end and runs toward it, arms held out in love. 
It is a love of death that sickens everything. 
A dead sun stains the newsprint. It is red. 
I lose life after life. The dark earth drinks them. 


She is the vampire of us all. So she supports us, 
Fattens us, is kind. Her mouth is red. 
I know her. I know her intimately- 
Old winter-face, old barren one, old time bomb. 
Men have used her meanly. She will eat them. 
Eat them, eat them, eat them in the end. 
The sun is down. I die. I make a death. 


FIRST VOICE: 
Who is he, this blue, furious boy, 
Shiny and strange, as if he had hurtled from a star? 
He is looking so angrily! 
He flew into the room, a shriek at his heel. 
The blue color pales. He is human after all. 
A red lotus opens in its bowl of blood; 
They are stitching me up with silk, as if I were a material. 


What did my fingers do before they held him ? 
What did my heart do, with its love ? 
I have never seen a thing so clear. 
His lids are like the lilac-flower 
And soft as a moth, his breath. 
I shall not let go. 
There is no guile or warp in him. May he keep so. 


SECOND VOICE: 
There is the moon in the high window. It is over. 
How winter fills my soul! And that chalk light 
Laying its scales on the windows, the windows of empty offices, 
Empty schoolrooms, empty churches. O so much emptiness! 
There is this cessation. This terrible cessation of everything. 
These bodies mounded around me now, these polar sleepers - 
What blue, moony ray ices their dreams ? 


181 


ig62 

I feel it enter me, cold, alien, like an instrument. 
And that mad, hard face at the end of it, that O-mouth 
Open in its gape of perpetual grieving. 
It is she that drags the blood-black sea around 
Month after month, with its voices of failure. 
I am helpless as the sea at the end of her string. 
I am restless. Restless and useless. I, too, create corpses. 


I shall move north. I shall move into a long blackness. 
I see myself as a shadow, neither man nor woman, 
Neither a woman, happy to be like a man, nor a man 
Blunt and flat enough to feel no lack. I feel a lack. 
I hold my fingers up, ten white pickets. 
See, the darkness is leaking from the cracks. 
I cannot contain it. I cannot contain my life. 


I shall be a heroine of the peripheral. 
I shall not be accused by isolate buttons, 
Holes in the heels of socks, the white mute faces 
Of unanswered letters, coffined in a letter case. 
I shall not be accused, I shall not be accused. 
The clock shall not find me wanting, nor these stars 
That rivet in place abyss after abyss. 


THIRD VOICE: 
I see her in my sleep, my red, terrible girl. 
She is crying through the glass that separates us. 
She is crying, and she is furious. 
Her cries are hooks that catch and grate like cats. 
It is by these hooks she climbs to my notice. 
She is crying at the dark, or at the stars 
That at such a distance from us shine and whirl. 


I think her little head is carved in wood, 
A red, hard wood, eyes shut and mouth wide open. 
And from the open mouth issue sharp cries 
Scratching at my sleep like arrows, 
Scratching at my sleep, and entering my side. 
My daughter has no teeth. Her mouth is wide. 
It utters such dark sounds it cannot be good.

FIRST VOICE: 
What is it that flings these innocent souls at us ? 
Look, they are so exhausted, they are all flat out 
In their canvas-sided cots, names tied to their wrists, 
The little silver trophies they've come so far for. 
There are some with thick black hair, there are some bald. 
Their skin tints are pink or sallow, brown or red; 
They are beginning to remember their differences. 


I think they are made of water; they have no expression. 
Their features are sleeping, like light on quiet water. 
They are the real monks and nuns in their identical garments. 
I see them showering like stars on to the world - 
On India, Africa, America, these miraculous ones, 
These pure, small images. They smell of milk. 
Their footsoles are untouched. They are walkers of air. 


Can nothingness be so prodigal ? 
Here is my son. 
His wide eye is that general, flat blue. 
He is turning to me like a little, blind, bright plant. 
One cry. It is the hook I hang on. 
And I am a river of milk. 
I am a warm hill. 


SECOND VOICE: 
I am not ugly. I am even beautiful. 
The mirror gives back a woman without deformity. 
The nurses give back my clothes, and an identity. 
It is usual, they say, for such a thing to happen. 
It is usual in my life, and the lives of others. 
I am one in five, something like that. I am not hopeless. 
I am beautiful as a statistic. Here is my lipstick. 


I draw on the old mouth. 
The red mouth I put by with my identity 
A day ago, two days, three days ago. It was a Friday. 
I do not even need a holiday; I can go to work today. 
I can love my husband, who will understand. 
Who will love me through the blur of my deformity 
As if I had lost an eye, a leg, a tongue. 


183 


ig62 

And so I stand, a little sightless. So I walk 

Away on wheels, instead of legs, they serve as well. 

And learn to speak with fingers, not a tongue. 

The body is resourceful. 

The body of a starfish can grow back its arms 

And newts are prodigal in legs. And may I be 

As prodigal in what lacks me. 

THIRD VOICE: 
She is a small island, asleep and peaceful, 


And I am a white ship hooting: Goodbye, goodbye. 

The day is blazing. It is very mournful. 

The flowers in this room are red and tropical. 

They have lived behind glass all their lives, they have been cared for 
tenderly. 

Now they face a winter of white sheets, white faces. 


There is very little to go into my suitcase. 


There are the clothes of a fat woman I do not know. 


There is my comb and brush. There is an emptiness. 


I am so vulnerable suddenly. 


I am a wound walking out of hospital. 


I am a wound that they are letting go. 


I leave my health behind. I leave someone 


Who would adhere to me: I undo her fingers like bandages: I go. 


SECOND VOICE: 
I am myself again. There are no loose ends. 
I am bled white as wax, I have no attachments. 
I am flat and virginal, which means nothing has happened, 
Nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and scrapped, begun again. 
These little black twigs do not think to bud, 
Nor do these dry, dry gutters dream of rain. 
This woman who meets me in windows-she is neat. 


So neat she is transparent, like a spirit. 


How shyly she superimposes her neat self 


On the inferno of African oranges, the heel-hung pigs. 
She is deferring to reality. 
It is I. It is I - 


Tasting the bitterness between my teeth. 


The incalculable malice of the everyday.

How long can I be a wall, keeping the wind off? 
How long can I be 
Gentling the sun with the shade of my hand, 
Intercepting the blue bolts of a cold moon? 
The voices of loneliness, the voices of sorrow 
Lap at my back ineluctably. 
How shall it soften them, this little lullaby ? 


How long can I be a wall around my green property ? 
How long can my hands 
Be a bandage to his hurt, and my words 
Bright birds in the sky, consoling, consoling ? 
It is a terrible thing 
To be so open: it is as if my heart 
Put on a face and walked into the world. 


THIRD VOICE: 
Today the colleges are drunk with spring. 
My black gown is a little funeral : 
It shows I am serious. 
The books I carry wedge into my side. 
I had an old wound once, but it is healing. 
I had a dream of an island, red with cries. 
It was a dream, and did not mean a thing. 


FIRST VOICE: 
Dawn flowers in the great elm outside the house. 
The swifts are back. They are shrieking like paper rockets. 
I hear the sound of the hours 
Widen and die in the hedgerows. I hear the moo of cows. 
The colors replenish themselves, and the wet 
Thatch smokes in the sun. 
The narcissi open white faces in the orchard. 


I am reassured. I am reassured. 
These are the clear bright colors of the nursery, 
The talking ducks, the happy lambs. 
I am simple again. I believe in miracles. 
I do not believe in those terrible children 
Who injure my sleep with their white eyes, their fingerless hands. 
They are not mine. They do not belong to me.

I shall meditate upon normality. 
I shall meditate upon my little son. 
He does not walk. He does not speak a word. 
He is still swaddled in white bands. 
But he is pink and perfect. He smiles so frequently. 
I have papered his room with big roses, 
I have painted little hearts on everything. 


I do not will him to be exceptional. 
It is the exception that interests the devil. 
It is the exception that climbs the sorrowful hill 
Or sits in the desert and hurts his mother's heart. 
I will him to be common, 
To love me as I love him, 
And to marry what he wants and where he will. 


THIRD VOICE: 
Hot noon in the meadows. The buttercups 
Swelter and melt, and the lovers 
Pass by, pass by. 
They are black and flat as shadows. 
It is so beautiful to have no attachments! 
I am solitary as grass. What is it I miss? 
Shall I ever find it, whatever it is ? 


The swans are gone. Still the river 
Remembers how white they were. 
It strives after them with its lights. 
It finds their shapes in a cloud. 
What is that bird that cries 
With such sorrow in its voice ? 
I am young as ever, it says. What is it I miss? 


SECOND VOICE: 
I am at home in the lamplight. The evenings are lengthening. 
I am mending a silk slip: my husband is reading. 
How beautifully the light includes these things. 
There is a kind of smoke in the spring air, 
A smoke that takes the parks, the little statues 
With pinkness, as if a tenderness awoke, 
A tenderness that did not tire, something healing.

I wait and ache. I think I have been healing. 
There is a great deal else to do. My hands 
Can stitch lace neatly on to this material. My husband 
Can turn and turn the pages of a book. 
And so we are at home together, after hours. 
It is only time that weighs upon our hands. 
It is only time, and that is not material. 


The streets may turn to paper suddenly, but I recover 
From the long fall, and find myself in bed, 
Safe on the mattress, hands braced, as for a fall. 
I find myself again. I am no shadow 
Though there is a shadow starting from my feet. I am a wife. 
The city waits and aches. The little grasses 
Crack through stone, and they are green with life.

 Little Fugue 

The yew's black fingers wag; 
Cold clouds go over. 
So the deaf and dumb 
Signal the blind, and are ignored. 


I like black statements. 
The featurelessness of that cloud, now! 
White as an eye all over! 
The eye of the blind pianist 


At my table on the ship. 
He felt for his food. 
His fingers had the noses of weasels. 
I couldn't stop looking. 


He could hear Beethoven: 
Black yew, white cloud, 
The horrific complications. 
Finger-traps-a tumult of keys.

Such a dark funnel, my father! 
I see your voice 

Black and leafy, as in my childhood, 

A yew hedge of orders, 

Gothic and barbarous, pure German. 

Dead men cry from it. 
I am guilty of nothing. 

The yew my Christ, then. 
Is it not as tortured ? 

And you, during the Great War 
In the California delicatessen 

Lopping the sausages! 

They color my sleep, 

Red, mottled, like cut necks. 

There was a silence! 

Great silence of another order. 
I was seven, I knew nothing. 

The world occurred. 

You had one leg, and a Prussian mind. 

Now similar clouds 

Are spreading their vacuous sheets. 

Do you say nothing ? 

I am lame in the memory. 

I remember a blue eye, 

A briefcase of tangerines. 

This was a man, then! 

Death opened, like a black tree, blackly.

The smile of iceboxes annihilates me. 
Such blue currents in the veins of my loved one! 
I hear her great heart purr. 
From her lips ampersands and percent signs 
Exit like kisses. 
It is Monday in her mind: morals 
Launder and present themselves. 
What am I to make of these contradictions ? 
I wear white cuffs, I bow. 
Is this love then, this red material 
Issuing from the steel needle that flies so blindingly ? 
It will make little dresses and coats, 
It will cover a dynasty. 
How her body opens and shuts - 
A Swiss watch, jeweled in the hinges! 
O heart, such disorganization! 
The stars are flashing like terrible numerals. 
ABC, her eyelids say.

Black lake, black boat, two black, cut-paper people.

Their shadows must cover Canada. 


A little light is filtering from the water flowers. 
Their leaves do not wish us to hurry: 
They are round and flat and full of dark advice. 


Cold worlds shake from the oar. 
The spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes. 
A snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand; 


Stars open among the lilies. 
Are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens ? 
This is the silence of astounded souls.

Among the Narcissi 

Spry, wry, and gray as these March sticks, 
Percy bows, in his blue peajacket, among the narcissi. 
He is recuperating from something on the lung. 


The narcissi, too, are bowing to some big thing: 
It rattles their stars on the green hill where Percy 
Nurses the hardship of his stitches, and walks and walks. 


There is a dignity to this; there is a formality- 
The flowers vivid as bandages, and the man mending. 
They bow and stand: they suffer such attacks! 


And the octogenarian loves the little flocks. 
He is quite blue; the terrible wind tries his breathing. 
The narcissi look up like children, quickly and whitely.

You said you would kill it this morning. 
Do not kill it. It startles me still, 
The jut of that odd, dark head, pacing 


Through the uncut grass on the elm's hill. 
It is something to own a pheasant, 
Or just to be visited at all. 


I am not mystical: it isn't 
As if I thought it had a spirit. 
It is simply in its element. 


That gives it a kingliness, a right. 
The print of its big foot last winter, 
The tail-track, on the snow in our court- 


The wonder of it, in that pallor, 
Through Crosshatch of sparrow and starling. 
Is it its rareness, then ? It is rare. 


But a dozen would be worth having, 
A hundred, on that hill-green and red, 
Crossing and recrossing: a fine thing! 


It is such a good shape, so vivid. 
It's a little cornucopia. 
It unclaps, brown as a leaf, and loud, 


Settles in the elm, and is easy. 
It was sunning in the narcissi. 
I trespass stupidly. Let be, let be.

For Ruth Fainlight 

I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root: 
It is what you fear. 
I do not fear it: I have been there. 


Is it the sea you hear in me, 
Its dissatisfactions ? 
Or the voice of nothing, that was your madness? 


Love is a shadow. 
How you lie and cry after it 
Listen: these are its hooves: it has gone off, like a horse. 


All night I shall gallop thus, impetuously, 
Till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf, 
Echoing, echoing. 


Or shall I bring you the sound of poisons ? 
This is rain now, this big hush. 
And this is the fruit of it: tin-white, like arsenic. 


I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets. 
Scorched to the root 
My red filaments burn and stand, a hand of wires. 


Now I break up in pieces that fly about like clubs. 
A wind of such violence 
Will tolerate no bystanding: I must shriek. 


The moon, also, is merciless: she would drag me 
Cruelly, being barren. 
Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have caught her. 


I let her go. I let her go 
Diminished and flat, as after radical surgery. 
How your bad dreams possess and endow me.

Nightly it flaps out 
Looking, with its hooks, for something to love.

That sleeps in me; 
All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity. 


Clouds pass and disperse. 
Are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables ? 
Is it for such I agitate my heart ? 


I am incapable of more knowledge. 
What is this, this face 
So murderous in its strangle of branches ? 


Its snaky acids kiss. 
It petrifies the will. These are the isolate, slow faults 
That kill, that kill, that kill.

It was a place of force- 
The wind gagging my mouth with my own blown hair, 
Tearing off my voice, and the sea 
Blinding me with its lights, the lives of the dead 
Unreeling in it, spreading like oil. 


I tasted the malignity of the gorse, 
Its black spikes, 
The extreme unction of its yellow candle-flowers. 
They had an efficiency, a great beauty, 
And were extravagant, like torture. 


There was only one place to get to. 
Simmering, perfumed, 
The paths narrowed into the hollow.

And the snares almost effaced themselves- 
Zeros, shutting on nothing, 


Set close, like birth pangs. 
The absence of shrieks 
Made a hole in the hot day, a vacancy. 
The glassy light was a clear wall, 
The thickets quiet. 


I felt a still busyness, an intent. 
I felt hands round a tea mug, dull, blunt, 
Ringing the white china. 
How they awaited him, those little deaths! 
They waited like sweethearts. They excited him. 


And we, too, had a relationship - 
Tight wires between us, 
Pegs too deep to uproot, and a mind like a ring 
Sliding shut on some quick thing, 
The constriction killing me also.

The child in the white crib revolves and sighs, 
Opens its mouth now, demanding. 
His little face is carved in pained, red wood.

There is this white wall, above which the sky creates itself- 
Infinite, green, utterly untouchable. 
Angels swim in it, and the stars, in indifference also. 
They are my medium. 
The sun dissolves on this wall, bleeding its lights. 


A gray wall now, clawed and bloody. 
Is there no way out of the mind ? 
Steps at my back spiral into a well. 
There are no trees or birds in this world, 
There is only a sourness. 


This red wall winces continually: 
A red fist, opening and closing, 
Two gray, papery bags - 
This is what I am made of, this and a terror 
Of being wheeled off under crosses and a rain of pietas. 


On a black wall, unidentifiable birds 
Swivel their heads and cry.

Boomerang like anchored elastics, hurting the owner.

Obscene bikinis hide in the dunes, 


Breasts and hips a confectioner's sugar 
Of little crystals, titillating the light, 


While a green pool opens its eye, 
Sick with what it has swallowed 


Limbs, images, shrieks. Behind the concrete bunkers 
Two lovers unstick themselves.

And my heart too small to bandage their terrible faults. 
This is the side of a man: his red ribs, 


The nerves bursting like trees, and this is the surgeon: 
One mirrory eye 


A facet of knowledge. 
On a striped mattress in one room 


An old man is vanishing. 
There is no help in his weeping wife. 


Where are the eye-stones, yellow and valuable, 
And the tongue, sapphire of ash.

A wedding-cake face in a paper frill. 
How superior he is now. 


It is like possessing a saint. 
The nurses in their wing-caps are no longer so beautiful; 


They are browning, like touched gardenias. 
The bed is rolled from the wall. 


This is what it is to be complete. It is horrible. 
Is he wearing pajamas or an evening suit 


Under the glued sheet from which his powdery beak 
Rises so whitely unbufFeted ? 


They propped his jaw with a book until it stiffened 
And folded his hands, that were shaking: goodbye, goodbye.

The pillow cases are sweetening.

Run fold upon fold far off, concealing their hollows, 


The hollows in which rock the thoughts of the wife 
Blunt, practical boats 


Full of dresses and hats and china and married daughters. 
In the parlor of the stone house 


One curtain is flickering from the open window, 
Flickering and pouring, a pitiful candle. 


This is the tongue of the dead man: remember, remember. 
How far he is now, his actions 


Around him like livingroom furniture, like a decor. 
As the pallors gather 


The pallors of hands and neighborly faces, 
The elate pallors of flying iris. 


They are flying off into nothing: remember us. 
The empty benches of memory look over stones, 


Marble facades with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils. 
It is so beautiful up here: it is a stopping place.

The voice of the priest, in thin air, 
Meets the corpse at the gate, 


Addressing it, while the hills roll the notes of the dead bell; 
A glitter of wheat and crude earth. 


What is the name of that color ? 
Old blood of caked walls the sun heals, 


Old blood of limb stumps, burnt hearts. 
The widow with her black pocketbook and three daughters, 


Necessary among the flowers, 
Enfolds her face like fine linen, 


Not to be spread again. 
While a sky, wormy with put-by smiles, 


Passes cloud after cloud. 
And the bride flowers expend a freshness, 


And the soul is a bride 
In a still place, and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless.

The world purrs, shut-off" and gentle.

Gliding up in low gear behind the cart. 


And the priest is a vessel, 
A tarred fabric, sorry and dull, 


Following the coffin on its flowery cart like a beautiful woman, 
A crest of breasts, eyelids and lips 


Storming the hilltop.

And a naked mouth, red and awkward. 


For a minute the sky pours into the hole like plasma. 
There is no hope, it is given up.

Assumes, like a meathook, the burden of his parts.

Is it for this you widen your eye-rings ? 


Is it for this the air motes depart ? 
They are not air motes, they are corpuscles.

Circle a womb of marble.

Cold glass, how you insert yourself

Of the white fists of old 

Letters and their death rattle 

When I came too close to the wastebasket. 

What did they know that I didn't? 

Grain by grain, they unrolled 

Sands where a dream of clear water 

Grinned like a getaway car. 

I am not subtle 

Love, love, and well, I was tired 

Of cardboard cartons the color of cement or a dog pack 

Holding in its hate 

Dully, under a pack of men in red jackets, 

And the eyes and times of the postmarks. 

This fire may lick and fawn, but it is merciless: 

A glass case 

My fingers would enter although 

They melt and sag, they are told 

Do not touch. 

And here is an end to the writing, 
The spry hooks that bend and cringe, and the smiles, the smiles. 
And at least it will be a good place now, the attic. 
At least I won't be strung just under the surface, 
Dumb fish 
With one tin eye, 
Watching for glints, 
Riding my Arctic 
Between this wish and that wish. 


So I poke at the carbon birds in my housedress. 
They are more beautiful than my bodiless owl, 
They console me - 
Rising and flying, but blinded. 
They would flutter off, black and glittering, they would be coal an 
Only they have nothing to say to anybody.

Between the yellow lettuces and the German cabbage 
Involved in its weird blue dreams, 
Involved as a foetus. 
And a name with black edges 


Wilts at my foot, 
Sinuous orchis 
In a nest of root-hairs and boredom- 
Pale eyes, patent-leather gutturals! 
Warm rain greases my hair, extinguishes nothing. 
My veins glow like trees. 
The dogs are tearing a fox. This is what it is like- 
A red burst and a cry 
That splits from its ripped bag and does not stop 
With the dead eye 
And the stuffed expression, but goes on 
Dyeing the air, 
Telling the particles of the clouds, the leaves, the water 
What immortality is. That it is immortal.

And a sky like a pig's backside, an utter lack of attention. 


But right now you are dumb. 
And I love your stupidity, 
The blind mirror of it. I look in

 A Birthday Present 

What is this, behind this veil, is it ugly, is it beautiful ? 
It is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges ? 


I am sure it is unique, I am sure it is just what I want. 
When I am quiet at my cooking I feel it looking, I feel it thinking 


'Is this the one I am to appear for, 
Is this the elect one, the one with black eye-pits and a scar? 


Measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus, 
Adhering to rules, to rules, to rules. 


Is this the one for the annunciation ? 
My god, what a laugh!' 


But it shimmers, it does not stop, and I think it wants me. 
I would not mind if it was bones, or a pearl button. 


I do not want much of a present, anyway, this year. 
After all I am alive only by accident. 


I would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way. 
Now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains, 


The diaphanous satins of a January window 
White as babies' bedding and glittering with dead breath. O ivory! 


It must be a tusk there, a ghost-column. 
Can you not see I do not mind what it is. 


Can you not give it to me ? 
Do not be ashamed-I do not mind if it is small.

Do not be mean, I am ready for enormity. 
Let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam, 


The glaze, the mirrory variety of it. 
Let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate. 


I know why you will not give it to me, 
You are terrified 


The world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it, 
Bossed, brazen, an antique shield, 


A marvel to your great-grandchildren. 
Do not be afraid, it is not so. 


I will only take it and go aside quietly. 
You will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle, 


No falling ribbons, no scream at the end. 
I do not think you credit me with this discretion. 


If you only knew how the veils were killing my days. 
To you they are only transparencies, clear air. 


But my god, the clouds are like cotton. 
Armies of them. They are carbon monoxide. 


Sweetly, sweetly I breathe in, 
Filling my veins with invisibles, with the million 


Probable motes that tick the years off my life. 
You are silver-suited for the occasion. O adding machine 


Is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole ? 
Must you stamp each piece in purple, 


Must you kill what you can ? 
There is this one thing I want today, and only you can give it to me. 


It stands at my window, big as the sky. 
It breathes from my sheets, the cold dead center

Where spilt lives congeal and stiffen to history. 
Let it not come by the mail, finger by finger. 


Let it not come by word of mouth, I should be sixty 
By the time the whole of it was delivered, and too numb to use it. 


Only let down the veil, the veil, the veil. 
If it were death 


I would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes. 
I would know you were serious. 


There would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday. 
And the knife not carve, but enter 


Pure and clean as the cry of a baby, 
And the universe slide from my side.

The Detective 

What was she doing when it blew in 
Over the seven hills, the red furrow, the blue mountain ? 
Was she arranging cups ? It is important. 
Was she at the window, listening ? 
In that valley the train shrieks echo like souls on hooks. 


That is the valley of death, though the cows thrive. 
In her garden the lies were shaking out their moist silks 
And the eyes of the killer moving sluglike and sidelong, 
Unable to face the fingers, those egotists. 
The fingers were tamping a woman into a wall, 


A body into a pipe, and the smoke rising. 
This is the smell of years burning, here in the kitchen, 
These are the deceits, tacked up like family photographs, 
And this is a man, look at his smile, 
The death weapon? No one is dead.

There is no body in the house at all. 
There is the smell of polish, there are plush carpets.

Bored hoodlum in a red room 
Where the wireless talks to itself like an elderly relative. 


Did it come like an arrow, did it come like a knife ? 
Which of the poisons is it? 
Which of the nerve-curlers, the convulsors? Did it electrify? 
This is a case without a body. 
The body does not come into it at all. 


It is a case of vaporization. 
The mouth first, its absence reported 
In the second year. It had been insatiable 
And in punishment was hung out like brown fruit 
To wrinkle and dry. 


The breasts next. 
These were harder, two white stones. 
The milk came yellow, then blue and sweet as water. 
There was no absence of lips, there were two children, 
But their bones showed, and the moon smiled. 


Then the dry wood, the gates, 
The brown motherly furrows, the whole estate. 
We walk on air, Watson. 
There is only the moon, embalmed in phosphorus. 
There is only a crow in a tree. Make notes.

The Courage of Shutting-Up 

The courage of the shut mouth, in spite of artillery! 
The line pink and quiet, a worm, basking.

And the outrage of a sky, the lined brain of it. 
The disks revolve, they ask to be heard -

ig62 

Loaded, as they are, with accounts of bastardies. 
Bastardies, usages, desertions and doubleness, 
The needle journeying in its groove, 
Silver beast between two dark canyons, 
A great surgeon, now a tattooist, 


Tattooing over and over the same blue grievances, 
The snakes, the babies, the tits 
On mermaids and two-legged dreamgirls. 
The surgeon is quiet, he does not speak. 
He has seen too much death, his hands are full of it. 


So the disks of the brain revolve, like the muzzles of cannon. 
Then there is that antique billhook, the tongue, 
Indefatigable, purple. Must it be cut out ? 
It has nine tails, it is dangerous. 
And the noise it flays from the air, once it gets going! 


No, the tongue, too, has been put by, 
Hung up in the library with the engravings of Rangoon 
And the fox heads, the otter heads, the heads of dead rabbits. 
It is a marvelous object- 
The things it has pierced in its time. 


But how about the eyes, the eyes, the eyes ? 
Mirrors can kill and talk, they are terrible rooms 
In which a torture goes on one can only watch. 
The face that lived in this mirror is the face of a dead man. 
Do not worry about the eyes - 


They may be white and shy, they are no stool pigeons, 
Their death rays folded like flags 
Of a country no longer heard of, 
An obstinate independency 
Insolvent among the mountains.

 The Bee Meeting 

Who are these people at the bridge to meet me ? They are the 

villagers 
The rector, the midwife, the sexton, the agent for bees. 
In my sleeveless summery dress I have no protection, 
And they are all gloved and covered, why did nobody tell me? 
They are smiling and taking out veils tacked to ancient hats. 

I am nude as a chicken neck, does nobody love me ? 
Yes, here is the secretary of bees with her white shop smock, 
Buttoning the cuffs at my wrists and the slit from my neck to my knees. 
Now I am milkweed silk, the bees will not notice. 
They will not smell my fear, my fear, my fear. 


Which is the rector now, is it that man in black ? 
Which is the midwife, is that her blue coat? 
Everybody is nodding a square black head, they are knights in visors, 
Breastplates of cheesecloth knotted under the armpits. 
Their smiles and their voices are changing. I am led through a beanfield. 


Strips of tinfoil winking like people, 
Feather dusters fanning their hands in a sea of bean flowers, 
Creamy bean flowers with black eyes and leaves like bored hearts. 
Is it blood clots the tendrils are dragging up that string ? 
No, no, it is scarlet flowers that will one day be edible. 


Now they are giving me a fashionable white straw Italian hat 
And a black veil that molds to my face, they are making me one of them. 
They are leading me to the shorn grove, the circle of hives. 
Is it the hawthorn that smells so sick ? 
The barren body of hawthorn, etherizing its children. 


Is it some operation that is taking place ? 
It is the surgeon my neighbors are waiting for, 
This apparition in a green helmet, 
Shining gloves and white suit. 
Is it the butcher, the grocer, the postman, someone I know? 


I cannot run, I am rooted, and the gorse hurts me 
With its yellow purses, its spiky armory.

I could not run without having to run forever. 
The white hive is snug as a virgin, 
Sealing off her brood cells, her honey, and quietly humming. 


Smoke rolls and scarves in the grove. 
The mind of the hive thinks this is the end of everything. 
Here they come, the outriders, on their hysterical elastics. 
If I stand very still, they will think I am cow-parsley, 
A gullible head untouched by their animosity, 


Not even nodding, a personage in a hedgerow. 
The villagers open the chambers, they are hunting the queen. 
Is she hiding, is she eating honey ? She is very clever. 
She is old, old, old, she must live another year, and she knows it. 
While in their fingerjoint cells the new virgins 


Dream of a duel they will win inevitably, 
A curtain of wax dividing them from the bride flight, 
The upflight of the murderess into a heaven that loves her. 
The villagers are moving the virgins, there will be no killing. 
The old queen does not show herself, is she so ungrateful ? 


I am exhausted, I am exhausted 
Pillar of white in a blackout of knives. 
I am the magician's girl who does not flinch. 
The villagers are untying their disguises, they are shaking hands. 
Whose is that long white box in the grove, what have they accomplished, 


why am I cold.

The Arrival of the Bee Box

I have to live with it overnight 
And I can't keep away from it. 
There are no windows, so I can't see what is in there. 
There is only a little grid, no exit. 


I put my eye to the grid. 


It is dark, dark, 


With the swarmy feeling of African hands 


Minute and shrunk for export, 


Black on black, angrily clambering. 


How can I let them out ? 
It is the noise that appalls me most of all, 


The unintelligible syllables. 
It is like a Roman mob, 


Small, taken one by one, but my god, together! 


I lay my ear to furious Latin. 
I am not a Caesar. 
I have simply ordered a box of maniacs. 
They can be sent back. 
They can die, I need feed them nothing, I am the owner. 


I wonder how hungry they are. 
I wonder if they would forget me 
If I just undid the locks and stood back and turned into a tree. 
There is the laburnum, its blond colonnades, 
And the petticoats of the cherry. 


They might ignore me immediately 
In my moon suit and funeral veil. 
I am no source of honey 
So why should they turn on me ? 


Tomorrow I will be sweet God, I will set them free.

Eight combs of yellow cups,

Brood cells gray as the fossils of shells 
Terrify me, they seem so old.

Her wings torn shawls, her long body 
Rubbed of its plush 
Poor and bare and unqueenly and even shameful.

Of winged, unmiraculous women, 
Honey-drudgers. 
I am no drudge 
Though for years I have eaten dust 
And dried plates with my dense hair.

He has nothing to do with the bee-seller or with me. 
Now he is gone 


In eight great bounds, a great scapegoat. 
Here is his slipper, here is another, 
And here the square of white linen 
He wore instead of a hat. 
He was sweet, 


The sweat of his efforts a rain 
Tugging the world to fruit. 
The bees found him out, 
Molding onto his lips like lies, 
Complicating his features. 


They thought death was worth it, but I 
Have a self to recover, a queen. 
Is she dead, is she sleeping ? 
Where has she been, 
With her lion-red body, her wings of glass ?

More terrible than she ever was, red 
Scar in the sky, red comet 
Over the engine that killed her 
The mausoleum, the wax house.

Mass after mass, saying Shh!

Still figures of ivory. 
The mud squirms with throats, 
Stepping stones for French bootsoles. 
The gilt and pink domes of Russia melt and float off 


In the furnace of greed. Clouds, clouds. 
So the swarm balls and deserts 
Seventy feet up, in a black pine tree. 
It must be shot down. Pom! Pom! 
So dumb it thinks bullets are thunder. 


It thinks they are the voice of God 
Condoning the beak, the claw, the grin of the dog 
Yellow-haunched, a pack-dog, 
Grinning over its bone of ivory 
Like the pack, the pack, like everybody. 


The bees have got so far. Seventy feet high! 
Russia, Poland and Germany! 
The mild hills, the same old magenta 
Fields shrunk to a penny 
Spun into a river, the river crossed. 


The bees argue, in their black ball, 
A flying hedgehog, all prickles.

Of their dream, the hived station 
Where trains, faithful to their steel arcs,

Dismembered, to a tod of ivy. 
So much for the charioteers, the outriders, the Grand Army! 
A red tatter, Napoleon! 


The last badge of victory. 
The swarm is knocked into a cocked straw hat. 
Elba, Elba, bleb on the sea! 
The white busts of marshals, admirals, generals 
Worming themselves into niches. 


How instructive this is! 
The dumb, banded bodies 
Walking the plank draped with Mother France's upholstery 
Into a new mausoleum, 
An ivory palace, a crotch pine. 


The man with gray hands smiles- 
The smile of a man of business, intensely practical. 
They are not hands at all 
But asbestos receptacles. 
Pom! Pom! 'They would have killed me.' 


Stings big as drawing pins! 
It seems bees have a notion of honor, 
A black intractable mind. 
Napoleon is pleased, he is pleased with everything. 
O Europe! O ton of honey!

This is the easy time, there is nothing doing.

Wintering in a dark without window 
At the heart of the house 
Next to the last tenant's rancid jam 
And the bottles of empty glitters 
Sir So-and-so's gin. 


This is the room I have never been in. 
This is the room I could never breathe in. 
The black bunched in there like a bat, 
No light 
But the torch and its faint 


Chinese yellow on appalling objects 
Black asininity. Decay. 
Possession. 
It is they who own me. 
Neither cruel nor indifferent, 


Only ignorant. 
This is the time of hanging on for the bees-the bees 
So slow I hardly know them, 
Filing like soldiers 
To the syrup tin 


To make up for the honey I've taken. 
Tate and Lyle keeps them going, 
The refined snow. 
It is Tate and Lyle they live on, instead of flowers. 
They take it. The cold sets in. 


Now they ball in a mass, 
Black 
Mind against all that white. 
The smile of the snow is white. 
It spreads itself out, a mile-long body of Meissen, 


Into which, on warm days, 
They can only carry their dead. 
The bees are all women, 
Maids and the long royal lady. 
They have got rid of the men,

The blunt, clumsy stumblers, the boors. 
Winter is for women 
The woman, still at her knitting, 
At the cradle of Spanish walnut, 
Her body a bulb in the cold and too dumb to think. 


Will the hive survive, will the gladiolas 
Succeed in banking their fires 
To enter another year ? 
What will they taste of, the Christmas roses ? 
The bees are flying. They taste the spring.

Wavery, indelible, true 
Through the African giraffe in its Edeny greenery,

They stare from a square, stiff frill. 
They are for export, 
One a fool, the other a fool.

I have the ticket for that. 
Come here, sweetie, out of the closet.

An engine, an engine 
Chuffing me off like a Jew. 
A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen. 
I began to talk like a Jew. 
I think I may well be a Jew.

And get back, back, back to you. 
I thought even the bones would do. 


But they pulled me out of the sack, 
And they stuck me together with glue. 
And then I knew what to do. 
I made a model of you, 
A man in black with a Meinkampf look 


And a love of the rack and the screw. 
And I said I do, I do. 
So daddy, I'm finally through. 
The black telephone's off at the root, 
The voices just can't worm through.

The vampire who said he was you 
And drank my blood for a year, 
Seven years, if you want to know. 
Daddy, you can lie back now.

And the villagers never liked you. 
They are dancing and stamping on you. 
They always knew it was you.

With her wiggly fingers and for a very small fee.

Starless and fatherless, a dark water.

 The Munich Mannequins 

Perfection is terrible, it cannot have children. 
Cold as snow breath, it tamps the womb 


Where the yew trees blow like hydras, 
The tree of life and the tree of life

I&3 


Unloosing their moons, month after month, to no purpose. 
The blood flood is the flood of love, 


The absolute sacrifice. 
It means: no more idols but me, 


Me and you. 
So, in their sulfur loveliness, in their smiles 


These mannequins lean tonight 
In Munich, morgue between Paris and Rome, 


Naked and bald in their furs, 
Orange lollies on silver sticks, 


Intolerable, without mind. 
The snow drops its pieces of darkness, 


Nobody's about. In the hotels 
Hands will be opening doors and setting 


Down shoes for a polish of carbon 
Into which broad toes will go tomorrow. 


O the domesticity of these windows, 
The baby lace, the green-leaved confectionery, 


The thick Germans slumbering in their bottomless Stolz. 
And the black phones on hooks 


Glittering 
Glittering and digesting 


Voicelessness. The snow has no voice.

Totem 

The engine is killing the track, the track is silver, 
It stretches into the distance. It will be eaten nevertheless. 


Its running is useless. 
At nightfall there is the beauty of drowned fields, 


Dawn gilds the farmers like pigs, 
Swaying slightly in their thick suits, 


White towers of Smithfield ahead, 
Fat haunches and blood on their minds. 


There is no mercy in the glitter of cleavers, 
The butcher's guillotine that whispers: 'How's this, how's this?' 


In the bowl the hare is aborted, 
Its baby head out of the way, embalmed in spice, 


Flayed of fur and humanity. 
Let us eat it like Plato's afterbirth, 


Let us eat it like Christ. 
These are the people that were important 


Their round eyes, their teeth, their grimaces 
On a stick that rattles and clicks, a counterfeit snake. 


Shall the hood of the cobra appall me 
The loneliness of its eye, the eye of the mountains 


Through which the sky eternally threads itself? 
The world is blood-hot and personal 


Dawn says, with its blood-flush. 
There is no terminus, only suitcases 


Out of which the same self unfolds like a suit 
Bald and shiny, with pockets of wishes, 


264 


1963 


Notions and tickets, short circuits and folding mirrors. 
I am mad, calls the spider, waving its many arms. 

And in truth it is terrible, 
Multiplied in the eyes of the flies. 


They buzz like blue children 
In nets of the infinite, 


Roped in at the end by the one 
Death with its many sticks.

Your clear eye is the one absolutely beautiful thing. 
I want to fill it with color and ducks, 
The zoo of the new 


Whose names you meditate- 
April snowdrop, Indian pipe, 
Little 


Stalk without wrinkle, 
Pool in which images 
Should be grand and classical 


Not this troublous 
Wringing of hands, this dark 
Ceiling without a star.

Paralytic 


It happens. Will it go on? 
My mind a rock, 
No fingers to grip, no tongue, 
My god the iron lung 


That loves me, pumps 
My two 
Dust bags in and out, 
Will not 


Let me relapse 
While the day outside glides by like ticker tape. 
The night brings violets, 
Tapestries of eyes, 


Lights, 
The soft anonymous 
Talkers:'You all right?' 
The starched, inaccessible breast. 


Dead egg, I lie 
Whole 
On a whole world I cannot touch, 
At the white, tight 


Drum of my sleeping couch 
Photographs visit me 
My wife, dead and flat, in 1920 furs, 
Mouth full of pearls, 


Two girls 
As flat as she, who whisper 'We're your daughters.' 
The still waters 
Wrap my lips, 


Eyes, nose and ears, 
A clear 
Cellophane I cannot crack. 
On my bare back 


266

I smile, a buddha, all 
Wants, desire 
Falling from me like rings 
Hugging their lights.

Of the magnolia, 
Drunk on its own scents, 
Asks nothing of life.

218 Gigolo 

Pocket watch, I tick well. 
The streets are lizardy crevices 
Sheer-sided, with holes where to hide. 
It is best to meet in a cul-de-sac, 


A palace of velvet 
With windows of mirrors. 
There one is safe, 
There are no family photographs, 


No rings through the nose, no cries. 
Bright fish hooks, the smiles of women 
Gulp at my bulk 
And I, in my snazzy blacks, 


Mill a litter of breasts like jellyfish. 
To nourish 
The cellos of moans I eat eggs - 
Eggs and fish, the essentials, 


The aphrodisiac squid. 
My mouth sags, 
The mouth of Christ 
When my engine reaches the end of it. 


267 


1963 


The tattle of my 
Gold joints, my way of turning 
Bitches to ripples of silver 
Rolls out a carpet, a hush. 


And there is no end, no end of it. 
I shall never grow old. New oysters 
Shriek in the sea and I 
Glitter like Fontainebleau 


Gratified, 
All the fall of water an eye 
Over whose pool I tenderly 
Lean and see me.

219 Mystic 

The air is a mill of hooks- 
Questions without answer, 
Glittering and drunk as flies 
Whose kiss stings unbearably 
In the fetid wombs of black air under pines in summer. 


I remember 
The dead smell of sun on wood cabins, 
The stiffness of sails, the long salt winding sheets. 
Once one has seen God, what is the remedy ? 
Once one has been seized up 


Without a part left over, 
Not a toe, not a finger, and used, 
Used utterly, in the sun's conflagrations, the stains 
That lengthen from ancient cathedrals 
What is the remedy ? 


The pill of the Communion tablet, 
The walking beside still water ? Memory ? 


268 


1963 


Or picking up the bright pieces 
Of Christ in the faces of rodents, 
The tame flower-nibblers, the ones 


Whose hopes are so low they are comfortable - 
The humpback in his small, washed cottage 
Under the spokes of the clematis. 
Is there no great love, only tenderness ? 
Does the sea 


Remember the walker upon it ? 
Meaning leaks from the molecules. 
The chimneys of the city breathe, the window sweats, 
The children leap in their cots. 
The sun blooms, it is a geranium. 


The heart has not stopped.

 Kindness 

Kindness glides about my house. 
Dame Kindness, she is so nice! 
The blue and red jewels of her rings smoke 
In the windows, the mirrors 
Are filling with smiles. 


What is so real as the cry of a child ? 
A rabbit's cry may be wilder 
But it has no soul. 
Sugar can cure everything, so Kindness says. 
Sugar is a necessary fluid, 


Its crystals a little poultice. 
O kindness, kindness 
Sweetly picking up pieces! 
My Japanese silks, desperate butterflies, 
May be pinned any minute, anesthetized. 


269 


1963 


And here you come, with a cup of tea 
Wreathed in steam. 
The blood jet is poetry, 
There is no stopping it. 
You hand me two children, two roses. 


22 J Words 

Axes 
After whose stroke the wood rings, 
And the echoes! 
Echoes traveling 
Off from the center like horses. 


The sap 
Wells like tears, like the 
Water striving 
To re-establish its mirror 
Over the rock 


That drops and turns, 
A white skull, 
Eaten by weedy greens. 
Years later I 
Encounter them on the road 


Words dry and riderless, 
The indefatigable hoof-taps. 
While 
From the bottom of the pool, fixed stars 
Govern a life. 

Contusion 


Color floods to the spot, dull purple. 
The rest of the body is all washed out, 
The color of pearl. 


In a pit of rock 
The sea sucks obsessively, 
One hollow the whole sea's pivot. 


The size of a fly, 
The doom mark 
Crawls down the wall. 


The heart shuts, 
The sea slides back, 
The mirrors are sheeted.

223 Balloons 

Since Christmas they have lived with us, 
Guileless and clear, 
Oval soul-animals, 
Taking up half the space, 
Moving and rubbing on the silk 


Invisible air drifts, 
Giving a shriek and pop 
When attacked, then scooting to rest, barely trembling. 
Yellow cathead, blue fish 
Such queer moons we live with 

Instead of dead furniture! 
Straw mats, white walls 
And these traveling 
Globes of thin air, red, green, 
Delighting 


271 


The heart like wishes or free 
Peacocks blessing 
Old ground with a feather 
Beaten in starry metals. 
Your small 


Brother is making 
His balloon squeak like a cat. 
Seeming to see 
A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it, 
He bites, 


Then sits 
Back, fat jug 
Contemplating a world clear as water. 
A red 
Shred in his little fist.

The woman is perfected. 
Her dead 


Body wears the smile of accomplishment, 
The illusion of a Greek necessity 


Flows in the scrolls of her toga, 
Her bare 


Feet seem to be saying: 
We have come so far, it is over. 


Each dead child coiled, a white serpent, 
One at each little 


Pitcher of milk, now empty. 
She has folded 


272 


I&3 

Them back into her body as petals 
Of a rose close when the garden 


Stiffens and odors bleed 
From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower. 


The moon has nothing to be sad about, 
Staring from her hood of bone. 


She is used to this sort of thing. 
Her blacks crackle and drag. 

Bitter Strawberries 

All that morning in the strawberry field 
They talked about the Russians. 
Squatted down between the rows 
We listened. 
We heard the head woman say, 
'Bomb them off the map.' 


Horseflies buzzed, paused and stung. 
And the taste of strawberries 
Turned thick and sour. 


Mary said slowly, 'I've got a fella 
Old enough to go. 
If anything should happen . . .' 


The sky was high and blue. 
Two children laughed at tag 
In the tall grass, 
Leaping awkward and long-legged 
Across the rutted road. 
The fields were full of bronzed young men 
Hoeing lettuce, weeding celery. 


'The draft is passed,' the woman said. 
'We ought to have bombed them long ago.' 
'Don't,' pleaded the little girl 
With blond braids. 


299 


 

Her blue eyes swam with vague terror. 
She added pettishly, 'I can't see why 
You're always talking this way . . .' 
'Oh, stop worrying, Nelda,' 
Snapped the woman sharply. 
She stood up, a thin commanding figure 
In faded dungarees. 
Businesslike she asked us, 'How many quarts?' 
She recorded the total in her notebook, 
And we all turned back to picking. 


Kneeling over the rows, 
We reached among the leaves 
With quick practiced hands, 
Cupping the berry protectively before 
Snapping off the stem 
Between thumb and forefinger. 


Family Reunion 

Outside in the street I hear 
A car door slam; voices coming near; 
Incoherent scraps of talk 
And high heels clicking up the walk; 
The doorbell rends the noonday heat 
With copper claws; 
A second's pause. 


The dull drums of my pulses beat 
Against a silence wearing thin. 
The door now opens from within. 
Oh, hear the clash of people meeting - 
The laughter and the screams of greeting: 

Fat always, and out of breath, 
A greasy smack on every cheek 
From Aunt Elizabeth; 
There, that's the pink, pleased squeak 
Of Cousin Jane, our spinster with 
The faded eyes 
And hands like nervous butterflies; 
While rough as splintered wood 

Across them all 
Rasps the jarring baritone of Uncle Paul; 

300 


 

The youngest nephew gives a fretful whine 
And drools at the reception line. 


Like a diver on a lofty spar of land 
Atop the flight of stairs I stand. 
A whirlpool leers at me, 
Absorbent as a sponge; 
I cast off my identity 
And make the fatal plunge. 


Female Author 

All day she plays at chess with the bones of the world: 
Favored (while suddenly the rains begin 
Beyond the window) she lies on cushions curled 
And nibbles an occasional bonbon of sin. 


Prim, pink-breasted, feminine, she nurses 
Chocolate fancies in rose-papered rooms 
Where polished highboys whisper creaking curses 
And hothouse roses shed immoral blooms. 


The garnets on her fingers twinkle quick 
And blood reflects across the manuscript; 
She muses on the odor, sweet and sick, 
Of festering gardenias in a crypt, 


And lost in subtle metaphor, retreats 
From gray child faces crying in the streets. 


April 18 

the slime of all my yesterdays 
rots in the hollow of my skull 


and if my stomach would contract 
because of some explicable phenomenon 
such as pregnancy or constipation 

I would not remember you 

301 


 

or that because of sleep 
infrequent as a moon of greencheese 
that because of food 
nourishing as violet leaves 
that because of these 


and in a few fatal yards of grass 
in a few spaces of sky and treetops 


a future was lost yesterday 
as easily and irretrievably 
as a tennis ball at twilight 


Gold mouths cry 

Gold mouths cry with the green young 
certainty of the bronze boy 
remembering a thousand autumns 
and how a hundred thousand leaves 
came sliding down his shoulderblades 
persuaded by his bronze heroic reason. 
We ignore the coming doom of gold 
and we are glad in this bright metal season. 
Even the dead laugh among the goldenrod. 


The bronze boy stands kneedeep in centuries, 
and never grieves, 
remembering a thousand autumns, 
with sunlight of a thousand years upon his lips 
and his eyes gone blind with leaves. 


Dirge for a Joker 

Always in the middle of a kiss 
Came the profane stimulus to cough; 
Always from the pulpit during service 
Leaned the devil prompting you to laugh. 


Behind mock-ceremony of your grief 
Lurked the burlesque instinct of the ham; 
You never altered your amused belief 
That life was a mere monumental sham. 


302 


 

From the comic accident of birth 

To the final grotesque joke of death 

Your malady of sacrilegious mirth 

Spread gay contagion with each clever breath. 

Now you must play the straight man for a term 
And tolerate the humor of the worm.

A Villanelle 

Clocks cry: stillness is a lie, my dear; 
The wheels revolve, the universe keeps running. 
(Proud you halt upon the spiral stair.) 


The asteroids turn traitor in the air, 
And planets plot with old elliptic cunning; 
Clocks cry: stillness is a lie, my dear. 


Red the unraveled rose sings in your hair: 
Blood springs eternal if the heart be burning. 
(Proud you halt upon the spiral stair.) 


Cryptic stars wind up the atmosphere, 
In solar schemes the tilted suns go turning; 
Clocks cry: stillness is a lie, my dear. 


Loud the immortal nightingales declare: 
Love flames forever if the flesh be yearning. 
(Proud you halt upon the spiral stair.) 


Circling zodiac compels the year. 
Intolerant beauty never will be learning. 
Clocks cry: stillness is a lie, my dear. 
(Proud you halt upon the spiral stair.) 


Cinderella 

The prince leans to the girl in scarlet heels, 

Her green eyes slant, hair flaring in a fan 

Of silver as the rondo slows; now reels 

Begin on tilted violins to span 

303 


 

The whole revolving tall glass palace hall* 
Where guests slide gliding into light like wine; 
Rose candles flicker on the lilac wall 
Reflecting in a million flagons' shine, 


And gilded couples all in whirling trance 
Follow holiday revel begun long since, 
Until near twelve the strange girl all at once 
Guilt-stricken halts, pales, clings to the prince 


As amid the hectic music and cocktail talk 
She hears the caustic ticking of the clock. 


Jilted 

My thoughts are crabbed and sallow, 
My tears like vinegar, 
Or the bitter blinking yellow 
Of an acetic star. 

Tonight the caustic wind, love, 
Gossips late and soon, 
And I wear the wry-faced pucker of 
The sour lemon moon. 

While like an early summer plum, 
Puny, green, and tart, 
Droops upon its wizened stem 
My lean, unripened heart. 

Sonnet: To Eva 

All right, let's say you could take a skull and break it 
The way you'd crack a clock; you'd crush the bone 
Between steel palms of inclination, take it, 
Observing the wreck of metal and rare stone. 


This was a woman: her loves and stratagems 
Betrayed in mute geometry of broken 
Cogs and disks, inane mechanic whims, 
And idle coils of jargon yet unspoken. 


304 


 

Not man nor demigod could put together 
The scraps of rusted reverie, the wheels 
Of notched tin platitudes concerning weather, 
Perfume, politics, and fixed ideals. 


The idiot bird leaps up and drunken leans 
To chirp the hour in lunatic thirteens. 

Bluebeard 

I am sending back the key 
that let me into bluebeard's study; 
because he would make love to me 
I am sending back the key; 
in his eye's darkroom I can see 
my X-rayed heart, dissected body: 
I am sending back the key 
that let me into bluebeard's study. 


Aquatic Nocturne 

deep in liquid indigo 
turquoise slivers 
of dilute light 

quiver in thin streaks 
of bright tinfoil 
on mobile jet: 

pale flounder 
waver by 
tilting silver: 

in the shallows 
agile minnows 
flicker gilt : 

grapeblue mussels 
dilate lithe and 
pliant valves: 

305 


 

dull lunar globes 
of bulbous jellyfish 
glow milkgreen: 

eels twirl 
in wily spirals 
on elusive tails: 


adroit lobsters 
amble darkly olive 
on shrewd claws: 

down where sound 
comes blunt and wan 
like the bronze tone 
of a sunken gong. 

Notes to a Neophyte 

Take the general mumble, 
blunt as the faceless gut 
of an anonymous clam, 
vernacular as the strut 
of a slug or small preamble 
by snail under hump of home: 

metamorphose the mollusk 
of vague vocabulary 
with structural discipline: 
stiffen the ordinary 
malleable mask 
to the granite grin of bone. 


For such a tempering task, 
heat furnace of paradox 
in an artifice of ice; 
make love and logic mix, 
and remember, if tedious risk 
seems to jeopardize this: 

it was a solar turbine 
gave molten earth a frame, 


306 


 

and it took the diamond stone 
a weight of world and time 
being crystallized from carbon 
to the hardest substance known. 

Metamorphoses of the Moon 

Cold moons withdraw, refusing to come to terms 
with the pilot who dares all heaven's harms 

to raid the zone where fate begins, 
flings silver gauntlet of his plane at space, 
demanding satisfaction; no duel takes place: 

the mute air merely thins and thins. 

Sky won't be drawn closer: absolute, 
it holds aloof, a shrouded parachute 

always the same distance from 
the falling man who never will abstain 
from asking, but inventive, hopes; in vain 

challenges the silent dome. 

No violation but gives dividends 
of slow disaster: the bitten apple ends 

the eden of bucolic eve: 
understanding breaks through the skull's shell 
and like a cuckoo in the nest makes hell 

for naive larks who starve and grieve. 

What prince has ever seized the shining grail 
but that it turned into a milking pail ? 

It's likely that each secret sought 
will prove to be some common parlor fake: 
a craft with paint and powder that can make 

cleopatra from a slut. 

For most exquisite truths are artifice 
framed in disciplines of fire and ice 

which conceal incongruous 
elements like dirty socks and scraps 
of day-old bread and egg-stained plates; perhaps 

such sophistry can placate us. 

307 


 

But yet the perverse imp within will probe 
beneath the fringes of forbidden robe, 

seduced by curiosity, 
until in disenchantment our eyes glut 
themselves on the clay toes and short clubfoot 

which mar the idol's sanctity. 

The choice between the mica mystery 
of moonlight or the pockmarked face we see 

through the scrupulous telescope 
is always to be made: innocence 
is a fairy-tale; intelligence 

hangs itself on its own rope. 

Either way we choose, the angry witch 
will punish us for saying which is which; 

in fatal equilibrium 
we poise on perilous poles that freeze us in 
a cross of contradiction, racked between 

the fact of doubt, the faith of dream. 

Dialogue En Route 

'If only something would happen!' 
sighed Eve, the elevator-girl ace, 
to Adam the arrogant matador 
as they shot past the forty-ninth floor 
in a rocketing vertical clockcase, 
fast as a fallible falcon. 

'I wish millionaire uncles and aunts 
would umbrella like liberal toadstools 
in a shower of Chanel, Dior gowns, 
filet mignon and walloping wines, 
a pack of philanthropical fools 
to indulge my extravagant wants.' 


Erect in his folderol cloak 
sham Adam the matador cried: 
'O may G-men all die of the choler, 
and my every chimerical dollar 
breed innumerable bills, bona fide: 
a hot hyperbolical joke!' 


308 


 

Said Eve: 'I wish venomous nematodes 
were bewitched to assiduous lovers, 
each one an inveterate gallant 
with Valentino's crack technical talent 
for recreation down under the covers: 
erotic and elegant episodes.' 


Added Adam, that simian swell, 
with his modish opposable thumb: 
'O for ubiquitous free aphrodisiacs, 
and for pumpkins to purr into Cadillacs 
and voluptuous Venus to come 
waltzing up to me out of her cockle-shell.' 


Breaking through gravity's garrison, 
Eve, the elevator-girl ace, 
and Adam the arrogant matador 
shot past the ninety-fourth floor 
to corral the conundrum of space 
at its cryptic celestial origin. 


They both watched the barometer sink 
as the world swiveled round in its orbit 
and thousands were born and dropped dead, 
when, from the inane overhead 
(too quick for the pair to absorb it), 
came a gargantuan galactic wink. 


To a Jilted Lover 

Cold on my narrow cot I lie 
and in sorrow look 
through my window-square of black: 


figured in the midnight sky, 
a mosaic of stars 
diagrams the falling years, 


while from the moon, my lover's eye 
chills me to death 
with radiance of his frozen faith. 


309 


 

Once I wounded him with so 
small a thorn 
I never thought his flesh would burn 


or that the heat within would grow 
until he stood 
incandescent as a god; 


now there is nowhere I can go 
to hide from him: 
moon and sun reflect his flame. 


In the morning all shall be 
the same again: 
stars pale before the angry dawn; 


the gilded cock will turn for me 
the rack of time 
until the peak of noon has come 


and by that glare, my love will see 
how I am still 
blazing in my golden hell. 


The Dream 

'Last night,' he said, 'I slept well 
except for two uncanny dreams 
that came before the change of weather 
when I rose and opened all 
the shutters to let warm wind feather 
with wet plumage through my rooms. 

'In the first dream I was driving 
down the dark in a black hearse 
with many men until I crashed 
a light, and right away a raving 
woman followed us and rushed 
to halt our car in headlong course. 

310 


 

'Crying, she came to the island 
where we stopped, and with a curse 
demanded that I pay a fine 
for being such a rude assailant 
and damaging the whole unseen 
lighting plant of the universe. 


'Behind me then I heard a voice 
warning me to hold her hand 
and kiss her on the mouth for she 
loved me and a brave embrace 
would avoid all penalty. 
"I know, I know," I told my friend. 


'But yet I waited to be fined 
and took the woman's bright subpoena 
(while she washed the way with tears), 
then drove to you upon the wind. . . . 
I do not tell you the nightmare 
which occurred to me in China.' 


Sonnet: To Time 

Today we move in jade and cease with garnet 
Amid the ticking jeweled clocks that mark 
Our years. Death comes in a casual steel car, yet 
We vaunt our days in neon and scorn the dark. 

But outside the diabolic steel of this 
Most plastic-windowed city, I can hear 
The lone wind raving in the gutter, his 
Voice crying exclusion in my ear. 

So cry for the pagan girl left picking olives 
Beside a sunblue sea, and mourn the flagon 
Raised to toast a thousand kings, for all gives 
Sorrow; weep for the legendary dragon. 

Time is a great machine of iron bars 
That drains eternally the milk of stars.

The Trial of Man 

The ordinary milkman brought that dawn 
Of destiny, delivered to the door 
In square hermetic bottles, while the sun 
Ruled decree of doomsday on the floor. 

The morning paper clocked the headline hour 
You drank your coffee like original sin, 
And at the jet-plane anger of God's roar 
Got up to let the suave blue policeman in. 

Impaled upon a stern angelic stare 
You were condemned to serve the legal limit 
And burn to death within your neon hell. 

Now, disciplined in the strict ancestral chair, 
You sit, solemn-eyed, about to vomit, 
The future an electrode in your skull. 

April Aubade 

Worship this world of watercolor mood 
in glass pagodas hung with veils of green 
where diamonds jangle hymns within the blood 
and sap ascends the steeple of the vein. 

A saintly sparrow jargons madrigals 
to waken dreamers in the milky dawn, 
while tulips bow like a college of cardinals 
before that papal paragon, the sun. 

Christened in a spindrift of snowdrop stars, 
where on pink-fluted feet the pigeons pass 
and jonquils sprout like Solomon's metaphors, 
my love and I go garlanded with grass. 

Again we are deluded and infer 
that somehow we are younger than we were.

Go get the goodly squab 

Go get the goodly squab in gold-lobed corn 
And pluck the droll-flecked quail where thick they lie; 
Reap the round blue pigeon from roof ridge, 
But let the fast-feathered eagle fly. 


Let the fast-feathered eagle fly 
And the skies crack through with thunder; 
Hide, hide, in the deep nest 
Lest the lightning strike you to cinder. 


Go snare the sleeping bear in leaf-lined den 
And trap the muskrat napping in slack sun; 
Dupe the dull sow lounging snout in mud, 
But let the galloping antelope run. 

Let the galloping antelope run 
And the snow blow up behind; 
Hide, hide, in the safe cave 
Lest the blizzard drive you blind. 


Go cull the purple snails from slothful shells 
And bait the drowsing trout by the brook's brim; 
Gather idle oysters from green shoals, 
But let the quicksilver mackerel swim. 


Let the quicksilver mackerel swim 
Where the black wave topples down; 
Hide, hide, in the warm port 
Lest the water drag you to drown.

Acrobat of space, 
the daring adjective

you'll halt the clock

Lament 

A Villanelle 

The sting of bees took away my father 

who walked in a swarming shroud of wings 
and scorned the tick of the falling weather. 

Lightning licked in a yellow lather 
but missed the mark with snaking fangs: 
the sting of bees took away my father. 

Trouncing the sea like a raging bather, 
he rode the flood in a pride of prongs 
and scorned the tick of the falling weather. 

A scowl of sun struck down my mother, 
tolling her grave with golden gongs, 
but the sting of bees took away my father. 

He counted the guns of god a bother, 
laughed at the ambush of angels' tongues, 
and scorned the tick of the falling weather. 

315 


 

O ransack the four winds and find another 

man who can mangle the grin of kings: 
the sting of bees took away my father 
who scorned the tick of the falling weather. 


Doomsday 

The idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans 
Atop the broken universal clock : 
The hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens. 

Our painted stages fall apart by scenes 
While all the actors halt in mortal shock: 
The idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans. 

Streets crack through in havoc-split ravines 
As the doomstruck city crumbles block by block: 
The hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens. 

Fractured glass flies down in smithereens; 
Our lucky relics have been put in hock: 
The idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans. 


God's monkey wrench has blasted all machines; 
We never thought to hear the holy cock: 
The hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens. 

Too late to ask if end was worth the means, 

Too late to calculate the toppling stock: 
The idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans, 
The hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens. 

Moonsong at Morning 

O moon of illusion, 
enchanting men 
with tinsel vision 
along the vein, 

cocks crow up a rival 
to mock your face 

316 


 

and eclipse that oval 
which conjured us 

to leave our reason 
and come to this 
fabled horizon 
of caprice. 

Dawn shall dissever 
your silver veil 
which let lover think lover 
beautiful; 

the light of logic 
will show us that 
all moonstruck magic 
is dissolute: 

no sweet disguises 

withstand that stare 
whose candor exposes 
love's paling sphere. 

In gardens of squalor 
the sleepers wake 
as their golden jailer 
turns the rack; 

each sacred body 
night yielded up 
is mangled by study 
of microscope : 

facts have blasted 
the angel's frame 
and stern truth twisted 
the radiant limb. 

Reflect in terror 
the scorching sun: 
dive at your mirror 
and drown within.

Doom of Exiles 

Now we, returning from the vaulted domes 
Of our colossal sleep, come home to find 
A tall metropolis of catacombs 
Erected down the gangways of our mind. 


Green alleys where we reveled have become 
The infernal haunt of demon dangers; 
Both seraph song and violins are dumb; 
Each clock tick consecrates the death of strangers. 


Backward we traveled to reclaim the day 
Before we fell, like Icarus, undone; 
All we find are altars in decay 
And profane words scrawled black across the sun. 


Still, stubbornly we try to crack the nut 
In which the riddle of our race is shut. 

The Dispossessed 

The enormous mortgage must be paid somehow, 
so if you can dream up any saving plan 
tell me quick, darling, tell me now. 

An odd disease has hit our holy cow, 
no milk or honey fills the empty can; 
the enormous mortgage must be paid somehow. 

If you've a plot to halt the lethal flow 
of weevil tribe and locust caravan 
tell me quick, darling, tell me now. 


Our creditor advances with a bow 
to cast lock, stock and barrel under ban; 
the enormous mortgage must be paid somehow. 

If you can think of means to mend the vow 
we broke the minute that the world began 
tell me quick, darling, tell me now.

Admonitions 

Oh never try to knock on rotten wood 
or play another card game when you've won; 
never try to know more than you should. 

The magic golden apples all look good 
although the wicked witch has poisoned one. 
oh never try to knock on rotten wo>i. 

From here the moon seems smooth as angel-food, 
from here you can't see spots upon the sun; 
never try to know more than you should. 

The suave dissembling cobra wears a hood 
and swaggers like a proper gentleman; 
oh never try to knock on rotten wood. 

While angels wear a wakeful attitude 
disguise beguiles and mortal mischiefs done: 
never try to know more than you should. 

For deadly secrets strike when understood 

and lucky stars all exit on the run : 
never try to knock on rotten wood, 
never try to know more than you should. 

Never try to trick me with a kiss 

Never try to trick me with a kiss 
Pretending that the birds are here to stay; 
The dying man will scoff in scorn at this. 

A stone can masquerade where no heart is 
And virgins rise where lustful Venus lay : 
Never try to trick me with a kiss. 

319 


 

Our noble doctor claims the pain is his, 
While stricken patients let him have his say; 
The dying man will scoff in scorn at this. 

Each virile bachelor dreads paralysis, 
The old maid in the gable cries all day: 
Never try to trick me with a kiss. 


The suave eternal serpents promise bliss 
To mortal children longing to be gay; 
The dying man will scoff in scorn at this. 


Sooner or later something goes amiss; 
The singing birds pack up and fly away; 
So never try to trick me with a kiss: 
The dying man will scoff in scorn at this. 


The Dead 

Revolving in oval loops of solar speed, 
Couched in cauls of clay as in holy robes, 
Dead men render love and war no heed, 
Lulled in the ample womb of the full-tilt globe. 


No spiritual Caesars are these dead; 
They want no proud paternal kingdom come; 
And when at last they blunder into bed 
World-wrecked, they seek only oblivion. 


Rolled round with goodly loam and cradled deep, 
These bone shanks will not wake immaculate 
To trumpet-toppling dawn of doomstruck day: 
They loll forever in colossal sleep; 
Nor can God's stern, shocked angels cry them up 
From their fond, final, infamous decay. 


Danse macabre 

Down among strict roots and rocks, 
eclipsed beneath blind lid of land 
goes the grass-embroidered box. 

320 


 

Arranged in sheets of ice, the fond 
skeleton still craves to have 
fever from the world behind. 


Hands reach back to relics of 
nippled moons, extinct and cold, 
frozen in designs of love. 


At twelve, each skull is aureoled 
with recollection's ticking thorns 
winding up the raveled mold. 


Needles nag like unicorns, 
assault a sleeping virgin's shroud 
till her stubborn body burns. 


Lured by brigands in the blood, 
shanks of bone now resurrect, 
inveigled to forsake the sod. 


Eloping from their slabs, abstract 
couples court by milk of moon: 
sheer silver blurs their phantom act. 


Luminous, the town of stone 
anticipates the warning sound 
of cockcrow crying up the dawn. 


With kiss of cinders, ghosts descend, 
compelled to deadlock underground. 


Circus in Three Rings 

In the circus tent of a hurricane 
designed by a drunken god 
my extravagant heart blows up again 
in a rampage of champagne-colored rain 
and the fragments whir like a weather vane 
while the angels all applaud. 

Daring as death and debonair 
I invade my lion's den; 
a rose of jeopardy flames in my hair 

321 


 

yet I flourish my whip with a fatal flair 
defending my perilous wounds with a chair 
while the gnawings of love begin. 


Mocking as Mephistopheles, 
eclipsed by magician's disguise, 
my demon of doom tilts on a trapeze, 
winged rabbits revolving about his knees, 
only to vanish with devilish ease 
in a smoke that sears my eyes. 


Prologue to Spring 

The winter landscape hangs in balance now, 
Transfixed by glare of blue from gorgon's eye; 
The skaters freeze within a stone tableau. 

Air alters into glass and the whole sky 
Grows brittle as a tilted china bowl; 
Hill and valley stiffen row on row. 

Each fallen leaf is trapped by spell of steel, 
Crimped like fern in the quartz atmosphere; 
Repose of sculpture holds the country still. 

What countermagic can undo the snare 
Which has stopped the season in its tracks 
And suspended all that might occur? 

Locked in crystal caskets are the lakes, 
Yet as we wonder what can come of ice 
Green-singing birds explode from all the rocks. 

Song for a Revolutionary Love 

O throw it away, throw it all away on the wind: 
first let the heavenly foliage go, 
and page by pride the good books blow; 

scatter smug angels with your hand. 

322 


 

Undo the doings of the fathering age: 
chuck the broken acropolis out, 
fling the seven wonders after that 

with struts and props of the holy stage. 

Disrupt the calendars next; send the duteous 
packing without a compass or scale 
to chart the measure of fortune's wheel; 

let nothing be left to swaddle us. 

Unravel antique samplers, unwind the clocks, 
till unruly children stream down the sky 
and old maids on impromptu petticoats fly 

with begonia and building blocks. 

Now empty boxes of the hoodwinked dead 
upon the pouring air until 
god hears from his great sunstruck hell 

the chittering crackpots that he made. 

Then hurl the bare world like a bluegreen ball 
back into the holocaust 
to burn away the humbug rust 

and again together begin it all. 

Sonnet to Satan 

In darkroom of your eye the mo<jnly mind 
somersaults to counterfeit eclipse : 
bright angels black out over logic's land 
under shutter of their handicaps. 


Commanding that corkscrew comet jet forth ink 
to pitch the white world down in swiveling flood, 
you overcast all order's noonday rank 
and turn god's radiant photograph to shade. 


Steepling snake in that contrary light 
invades the dilate lens of genesis 
to print your flaming image in birthspot 
with characters no cockcrow can deface. 


O maker of proud planet's negative, 
obscure the scalding sun till no clocks move.

A Sorcerer Bids Farewell to Seem 

I'm through with this grand looking-glass hotel 
where adjectives play croquet with flamingo nouns; 
methinks I shall absent me for a while 
from rhetoric of these rococo queens. 
Item: chuck out royal rigmarole of props 
and auction off each rare white-rabbit verb; 
send my muse Alice packing with gaudy scraps 
of mushroom simile and gryphon garb. 


My native sleight-of-hand is wearing out: 
mad hatter's hat yields no new metaphor, 
the jabberwock will not translate his songs: 
it's time to vanish like the Cheshire cat 
alone to that authentic island where 
cabbages are cabbages; kings: kings. 


Midsummer Mobile 

Begin by dipping your brush into clear light. 
Then syncopate a sky of Dufy-blue 
With tilted spars of sloops revolved by white 
Gulls in a feathered fugue of wings. Outdo 


Seurat: fleck schooner flanks with sun and set 
A tremolo of turquoise quivering in 
The tessellated wave. Now nimbly let 
A tinsel pizzicato on fish fin 


Be plucked from caves of dappled amber where 
A mermaid odalisque lolls at her ease 
With orange scallops tangled in wet hair, 
Fresh from the mellow palette of Matisse: 


Suspend this day, so singularly designed, 
Like a rare Calder mobile in your mind. 


324 


 


On Looking into the Eyes of a Demon Lover 


Here are two pupils 
whose moons of black 
transform to cripples 
all who look: 

each lovely lady 
who peers inside 
takes on the body 
of a toad. 

Within these mirrors 
the world inverts: 
the fond admirer's 
burning darts 

turn back to injure 

the thrusting hand 
and inflame to danger 
the scarlet wound. 

I sought my image 
in the scorching glass, 
for what fire could damage 
a witch's face ? 

So I stared in that furnace 
where beauties char 
but found radiant Venus 
reflected there. 

Insolent storm strikes at the skull 

Insolent storm strikes at the skull, 

assaults the sleeping citadel, 

knocking the warden to his knees 

- 
in impotence, to sue for peace, 
while wantonly amused by this, 
wind wakes the whole metropolis. 
Skeptic cyclones try the bone 
of strict and sacred skeleton; 
polemic gales prove point by point 
325 


 

how flesh cleaves fast to frozen joint, 
and a hurricane headache rocks 
the temples of the orthodox. 


Abracadabra of the rain 
drowns Noah's prayers with distain, 
drives priest and prostitute in doorways, 
bereft of Moses and of mores; 
no ancient blueprint builds an ark 
to navigate this final dark. 
River floods transcend the level 
demarcating good from evil, 
and casuist arguments run riot 
inundating Eden's quiet: 
all absolutes that angels give 
flounder in the relative. 


Lightning conjures God's globe off" its 
orbit; neither law nor prophets 
can rectify truant intent 
to doublecross the firmament. 
Now earth rejects communication 
with heaven's autocratic station, 
and violates celestial custom 
by seceding from the solar system. 
Scintillant irony inspires 
independent rebel fires 
till the Announcer's voice is lost 
in heresies of holocaust. 


Denouement 

The telegram says you have gone away 
And left our bankrupt circus on its own; 
There is nothing more for me to say. 


The maestro gives the singing birds their pay 
And they buy tickets for the tropic zone; 
The telegram says you have gone away. 


The clever woolly dogs have had their day 
They shoot the dice for one remaining bone; 
There is nothing more for me to say. 


326 


 

The lion and the tigers turn to clay 
And Jumbo sadly trumpets into stone; 
The telegram says you have gone away. 


The morbid cobra's wits have run astray; 
He rents his poisons out by telephone; 
There is nothing more for me to say. 


The colored tents all topple in the bay; 
The magic sawdust writes: address unknown. 
The telegram says you have gone away; 
There is nothing more for me to say. 


Two Lovers and a Beachcomber by the Real Sea 

Cold and final, the imagination 
Shuts down its fabled summer house; 
Blue views are boarded up; our sweet vacation 
Dwindles in the hour-glass. 

Thoughts that found a maze of mermaid hair 
Tangling in the tide's green fall 
Now fold their wings like bats and disappear 
Into the attic of the skull. 

We are not what we might be; what we are 
Outlaws all extrapolation 
Beyond the interval of now and here: 
White whales are gone with the white ocean. 

A lone beachcomber squats among the wrack 
Of kaleidoscopic shells 
Probing fractured Venus with a stick 
Under a tent of taunting gulls. 

No sea-change decks the sunken shank of bone 
That chuckles in backtrack of the wave; 
Though the mind like an oyster labors on and on, 
A grain of sand is all we have. 

Water will run by rule; the actual sun 
Will scrupulously rise and set; 
No little man lives in the exacting moon 
And that is that, is that, is that. 


327 


 

Black Pine Tree in an Orange Light 

Tell me what you see in it: 
the pine tree like a Rorschach-blot 
black against the orange light: 

Plant an orange pumpkin patch 
which at twelve will quaintly hatch 
nine black mice with ebon coach, 

or walk into the orange and make 
a devil's cataract of black 
obscure god's eye with corkscrew fleck; 

put orange mistress half in sun, 
half in shade, until her skin 
tattoos black leaves on tangerine. 

Read black magic or holy book 
or lyric of love in the orange and black 
till dark is conquered by orange cock, 

but more pragmatic than all of this, 
say how crafty the painter was 
to make orange and black ambiguous. 

Terminal 

Riding home from credulous blue domes, 
the dreamer reins his waking appetite 
in panic at the crop of catacombs 
sprung up like plague of toadstools overnight: 
refectories where he reveled have become 
the hostelry of worms, rapacious blades 
who weave within the skeleton's white womb 
a caviare decay of rich brocades. 


Turning the tables of this grave gourmet, 
the fiendish butler saunters in and serves 
for feast the sweetest meat of hell's chef d'oeuvres: 
his own pale bride upon a flaming tray: 
parsleyed with elegies, she lies in state 
waiting for his grace to consecrate. 


328 


 

Love Is a Parallax 

'Perspective betrays with its dichotomy: 
train tracks always meet, not here, but only 

in the impossible mind's eye; 
horizons beat a retreat as we embark 
on sophist seas to overtake that mark 

where wave pretends to drench real sky.' 

'Well then, if we agree, it is not odd 
that one man's devil is another's god 

or that the solar spectrum is 
a multitude of shaded grays; suspense 
on the quicksands of ambivalence 

is our life's whole nemesis.' 

So we could rave on, darling, you and I, 
until the stars tick out a lullaby 

about each cosmic pro and con; 
nothing changes, for all the blazing of 
our drastic jargon, but clock hands that move 

implacably from twelve to one. 

We raise our arguments like sitting ducks 
to knock them down with logic or with luck 

and contradict ourselves for fun; 
the waitress holds our coats and we put on 
the raw wind like a scarf; love is a faun 

who insists his playmates run. 

Now you, my intellectual leprechaun, 
would have me swallow the entire sun 

like an enormous oyster, down 
the ocean in one gulp: you say a mark 
of comet hara-kiri through the dark 

should inflame the sleeping town. 

So kiss: the drunks upon the curb and dames 
in dubious doorways forget their monday names, 

caper with candles in their heads; 
the leaves applaud, and santa claus flies in 
scattering candy from a zeppelin, 

playing his prodigal charades. 

329 


 

The moon leans down to look; the tilting fish 
in the rare river wink and laugh; we lavish 

blessings right and left and cry 
hello, and then hello again in deaf 
churchyard ears until the starlit stiff 

graves all carol in reply. 

Now kiss again: till our strict father leans 
to call for curtain on our thousand scenes; 

brazen actors mock at him, 
multiply pink harlequins and sing 
in gay ventriloquy from wing to wing 

while footlights flare and houselights dim. 

Tell now, we taunt, where black or white begins 
and separate the flutes from violins : 

the algebra of absolutes 
explodes in a kaleidoscope of shapes 
that jar, while each polemic jackanapes 

joins his enemies' recruits. 

The paradox is that 'the play's the thing': 
though prima donna pouts and critic stings, 

there burns throughout the line of words, 
the cultivated act, a fierce brief fusion 
which dreamers call real, and realists, illusion: 

an insight like the flight of birds: 

Arrows that lacerate the sky, while knowing 
the secret of their ecstasy's in going; 

some day, moving, one will drop, 
and, dropping, die, to trace a wound that heals 
only to reopen as flesh congeals: 

cycling phoenix never stops. 

So we shall walk barefoot on walnut shells 
of withered worlds, and stamp out puny hells 

and heavens till the spirits squeak 
surrender: to build our bed as high as jack's 
bold beanstalk; lie and love till sharp scythe hacks 

away our rationed days and weeks. 

Then let the blue tent topple, stars rain down, 
and god or void appall us till we drown 
in our own tears: today we start 

330 


 

to pay the piper with each breath, yet love 

knows not of death nor calculus above 
the simple sum of heart plus heart. 

Aerialist 

Each night, this adroit young lady 
Lies among sheets 
Shredded fine as snowflakes 
Until dream takes her body 
From bed to strict tryouts 
In tightrope acrobatics. 


Nightly she balances 
Cat-clever on perilous wire 
In a gigantic hall, 
Footing her delicate dances 
To whipcrack and roar 
Which speak her maestro's will. 


Gilded, coming correct 
Across that sultry air, 
She steps, halts, hung 
In dead center of her act 
As great weights drop all about her 
And commence to swing. 


Lessoned thus, the girl 
Parries the lunge and menace 
Of every pendulum; 
By deft duck and twirl 
She draws applause; bright harness 
Bites keen into each brave limb 


Then, this tough stint done, she curtsies 
And serenely plummets down 
To traverse glass floor 
And get safe home; but, turning with trained eyes, 
Tiger-tamer and grinning clown 
Squat, bowling black balls at her. 

Tall trucks roll in 
With a thunder like lions; all aims 
And lumbering moves 


331 


 

To trap this outrageous nimble queen 
And shatter to atoms 
Her nine so slippery lives. 

Sighting the stratagem 
Of black weight, black ball, black truck, 
With a last artful dodge she leaps 
Through hoop of that hazardous dream 
To sit up stark awake 
As the loud alarmclock stops. 

Now as penalty for her skill, 
By day she must walk in dread 
Steel gauntlets of traffic, terror-struck 
Lest, out of spite, the whole 
Elaborate scaffold of sky overhead 
Fall racketing finale on her luck. 

Morning in the Hospital Solarium 

Sunlight strikes a glass of grapefruit juice, 
flaring green through philodendron leaves 
in this surrealistic house 
of pink and beige, impeccable bamboo, 
patronized by convalescent wives; 
heat shadows waver noiseless in 
bright window-squares until the women seem 
to float like dream-fish in the languid limbo 
of an undulant aquarium. 


Morning: another day, and talk 
taxis indolent on whispered wheels; 
the starched white coat, the cat's paw walk, 
herald distraction: a flock of pastel pills, 
turquoise, rose, sierra mauve; needles 
that sting no more than love: a room where time 
ticks tempo to the casual climb 
of mercury in graded tubes, where ills 
slowly concede to sun and serum. 

Like petulant parakeets corked up in cages 
of intricate spunglass routine, 
the women wait, fluttering, turning pages 
of magazines in elegant ennui, 


332 


 

hoping for some incredible dark man 
to assault the scene and make some 
gaudy miracle occur, to come 
and like a burglar steal their fancy: 
at noon, anemic husbands visit them. 


The Princess and the Goblins 

(O 

From fabrication springs the spiral stair 
up which the wakeful princess climbs to find 
the source of blanching light that conjured her 

to leave her bed of fever and ascend 
a visionary ladder toward the moon 
whose holy blue anoints her injured hand. 

With finger bandaged where the waspish pin 
flew from the intricate embroidery 
and stung according to the witch's plan, 

she mounts through malice of the needle's eye, 
trailing her scrupulously simple gown 
along bright asterisks by milky way. 

Colonnades of angels nod her in 
where ancient, infinite, and beautiful, 
her legendary godmother leans down, 

spinning a single stubborn thread of wool 
which all the artful wizards cannot crimp 
to keep the young girl from her crowning goal. 

Initiated by the lunar lamp, 
kindling her within a steepled flame, 
the princess hears the thunder and the pomp 

of squadrons underground abducting him 
who is the destination of the cord 
now bound around her wrist till she redeem 
this miner's boy from goblin bodyguard. 

333 


 

(2) 
Guided only by the tug and twitch 
of that mercurial strand, the girl goes down 
the darkening stair, undoes the palace latch 

and slips unseen past watchmen on the lawn 
dozing around their silvered sentry box. 
Across the frosted grass she marks the sheen 

of thread conducting her to the worn tracks 
made by miners up the mountainside 
among the jagged mazes of the rocks. 

Laboring on the tilt of that steep grade 
behind which the declining moon has set, 
she recalls queer stories her nurse read 

about a goblin raid on miner's hut 
because new excavations came too near 
the chambers where their fiendish queen would sit. 

Hearing a weird cackle from afar, 
she clutches at the talismanic cord 
and confronts a cairn of iron ore. 

Suddenly a brazen song is heard 
from the pragmatic boy confined within, 
gaily cursing the whole goblin horde. 

Inviolate in the circle of that skein, 
looping like faith about her bleeding feet, 
the princess frees the miner, stone by stone, 
and leads him home to be her chosen knight. 

(3) 
The princess coaxes the incredulous boy 
through candid kitchens in the rising sun 
to seek the staircase by the glare of day. 

Hand in hand, they scale meridian, 
clambering up the creaking heights of heat 
until she hears the twittering machine 

334 


 

which quaintly wove the fabric of her fate 
behind the zodiac on attic door 
with abracadabra from the alphabet. 

Pointing toward the spindle's cryptic whir, 
she tells the greenhorn miner to bow down 
and honor the great goddess of the air 

suspended aloft within her planet-shine. 
Laughing aloud, the dazzled boy demands 
why he should kneel before a silly scene 

where pigeons promenade the gable-ends 
and coo quadrilles about the blighted core 
in a batch of raveled apple rinds. 

At his words, the indignant godmother 
vanishes in a labyrinth of hay 
while sunlight winds its yarn upon the floor. 

O never again will the extravagant straw 
knit up a gilded fable for the child 
who weeps before the desolate tableau 
of clockwork that makes the royal blood run cold. 

Touch-and-Go 

Sing praise for statuary: 
For those anchored attitudes 
And staunch stone eyes that stare 
Through lichen-lid and passing bird-foot 
At some steadfast mark 
Beyond the inconstant green 
Gallop and flick of light 
In this precarious park 

Where vivid children twirl 
Like colored tops through time 
Nor stop to understand 
How all their play is touch-and-go: 
But, Go! they cry, and the swing 
Arcs up to the tall tree tip; 
Go! and the merry-go-round 
Hauls them round with it. 


335 


 

And I, like the children, caught 
In the mortal active verb, 
Let my transient eye break a tear 
For each quick, flaring game 
Of child, leaf and cloud, 
While on this same fugue, unmoved, 
Those stonier eyes look, 
Safe-socketed in rock. 


Temper of Time 

An ill wind is stalking 
While evil stars whir 
And all the gold apples 
Go bad to the core. 


Black birds of omen 
Now prowl on the bough; 
With a hiss of disaster 
Sibyl's leaves blow. 

Through closets of copses 
Tall skeletons walk; 
Nightshade and nettles 
Tangle the track. 

In the ramshackle meadow 
Where Kilroy would pass 
Lurks the sickle-shaped shadow 
Of snake in the grass. 

Approaching his cottage 
By crooked detour, 
He hears the gruff knocking 
Of the wolf at the door. 

His wife and his children 
Hang riddled with shot, 
There's a hex on the cradle 
And death in the pot.

Epitaph in Three Parts 

(i) 
Rocking across the lapis lazuli sea 
comes a flock of bottle battleships 
each with a telegram addressed to me. 

'Destroy your mirror and avoid mishaps,' 
chirps the first; 'live on a silent island 
where the water blots out all footsteps.' 

The second sings: 'Receive no roving gallant 
who seeks to dally in the port till dawn, 
for your fate involves a dark assailant.' 

The third cries out as all the ships go down: 
'There is more than one good way to drown.' 

In the air above my island flies 
a crowd of shining gulls that plunge to launch 
an accurate assault upon the eyes 

of the bold sailor falling under drench 
and hunger of the surf that plucks the land, 
devouring green gardens inch by inch. 

Blood runs in a glissando from the hand 
that lifts to consecrate the sunken man. 
Aloft, a lone gull halts upon the wind, 

announcing after glutted birds have flown: 
'There is more than one good way to drown.' 

(3) 
Grasshopper goblins with green pointed ears 
caper on leafstalk legs across my doorsill, 
and mock the jangling rain of splintered stars. 

My room is a twittering gray box with a wall 
there and there and there again, and then 
a window which proves the sky sheer rigmarole 

337 


 

that happens to conceal the lid of one 
enormous box of gray where god has gone 
and hidden all the bright angelic men. 

A wave of grass engraves upon the stone: 
'There is more than one good way to drown.' 

It was a QUEER, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York. I'm stupid about executions. The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and that's all there was to read about in the papers -- goggle-eyed headlines staring up at me on every street corner and at the fusty, peanut-smelling mouth of every subway. It had nothing to do with me, but I couldn't help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive all along your nerves. 
I thought it must be the worst thing in the world. 
New York was bad enough. By nine in the morning the fake, country-wet freshness that somehow seeped in overnight evaporated like the tail end of a sweet dream. Mirage-gray at the bottom of their granite canyons, the hot streets wavered in the sun, the car tops sizzled and glittered, and the dry, cindery dust blew into my eyes and down my throat. 
I kept hearing about the Rosenbergs over the radio and at the office till I couldn't get them out of my mind. It was like the first time I saw a cadaver. For weeks afterward, the cadaver's head -- or what there was left of it -- floated up behind my eggs and bacon at breakfast and behind the face of Buddy Willard, who was responsible for my seeing it in the first place, and pretty soon I felt as though I were carrying that cadaver's head around with me on a string, like some black, noseless balloon stinking of vinegar. 
I knew something was wrong with me that summer, because all I could think about was the Rosenbergs and how stupid I'd been to buy all those uncomfortable, expensive clothes, hanging limp as fish in my closet, and how all the little successes I'd totted up so happily at college fizzled to nothing outside the slick marble and plate-glass fronts along Madison Avenue. 
I was supposed to be having the time of my life. 
I was supposed to be the envy of thousands of other college girls just like me all over America who wanted nothing more than to be tripping about in those same size-seven patent leather shoes I'd bought in Bloomingdale's one lunch hour with a black patent leather belt and black patent leather pocketbook to match. And when my picture came out in the magazine the twelve of us were working on -- drinking martinis in a skimpy, imitation silver-lamÈ bodice stuck on to a big, fat cloud of white tulle, on some Starlight Roof, in the company of several anonymous young men with all-American bone structures hired or loaned for the occasion -- everybody would think I must be having a real whirl. 
Look what can happen in this country, they'd say. A girl lives in some out-of-the≠way town for nineteen years, so poor she can't afford a magazine, and then she gets a scholarship to college and wins a prize here and a prize there and ends up steering New York like her own private car. 
Only I wasn't steering anything, not even myself. I just bumped from my hotel to work and to parties and from parties to my hotel and back to work like a numb trolleybus. I guess I should have been excited the way most of the other girls were, but I couldn't get myself to react. I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo. 
There were twelve of us at the hotel. 
We had all won a fashion magazine contest, by writing essays and stories and poems and fashion blurbs, and as prizes they gave us jobs in New York for a month, expenses paid, and piles and piles of free bonuses, like ballet tickets and passes to fashion shows and hair stylings at a famous expensive salon and chances to meet successful people in the field of our desire and advice about what to do with our particular complexions. 
I still have the make-up kit they gave me, fitted out for a person with brown eyes and brown hair: an oblong of brown mascara with a tiny brush, and a round basin of blue eyeshadow just big enough to dab the tip of your finger in, and three lipsticks ranging from red to pink, all cased in the same little gilt box with a mirror on one side. I also have a white plastic sunglasses case with colored shells and sequins and a green plastic starfish sewed onto it. 
I realized we kept piling up these presents because it was as good as free advertising for the firms involved, but I couldn't be cynical. I got such a kick out of all those free gifts showering on to us. For a long time afterward I hid them away, but later, when I was all right again, I brought them out, and I still have them around the house. I use the lipsticks now and then, and last week I cut the plastic starfish off the sunglasses case for the baby to play with. 
So there were twelve of us at the hotel, in the same wing on the same floor in single rooms, one after the other, and it reminded me of my dormitory at college. It wasn't a proper hotel -- I mean a hotel where there are both men and women mixed about here and there on the same floor. 
This hotel -- the Amazon -- was for women only, and they were mostly girls my age with wealthy parents who wanted to be sure their daughters would be living where men couldn't get at them and deceive them; and they were all going to posh secretarial schools like Katy Gibbs, where they had to wear hats and stockings and gloves to class, or they had just graduated from places like Katy Gibbs and were secretaries to executives and simply hanging around in New York waiting to get married to some career man or other. 
These girls looked awfully bored to me. I saw them on the sunroof, yawning and painting their nails and trying to keep up their Bermuda tans, and they seemed bored as hell. I talked with one of them, and she was bored with yachts and bored with flying around in airplanes and bored with skiing in Switzerland at Christmas and bored with the men in Brazil. 
Girls like that make me sick. I'm so jealous I can't speak. Nineteen years, and I hadn't been out of New England except for this trip to New York. It was my first big chance, but here I was, sitting back and letting it run through my fingers like so much water. 
I guess one of my troubles was Doreen. 
I'd never known a girl like Doreen before. Doreen came from a society girls' college down South and had bright white hair standing out in a cotton candy fluff round her head and blue eyes like transparent agate marbles, hard and polished and just about indestructible, and a mouth set in a sort of perpetual sneer. I don't mean a nasty sneer, but an amused, mysterious sneer, as if all the people around her were pretty silly and she could tell some good jokes on them if she wanted to. 
Doreen singled me out right away. She made me feel I was that much sharper than the others, and she really was wonderfully funny. She used to sit next to me at the conference table, and when the visiting celebrities were talking she'd whisper witty sarcastic remarks to me under her breath. 
Her college was so fashion conscious, she said, that all the girls had pocketbook covers made out of the same material as their dresses, so each time they changed their clothes they had a matching pocketbook. This kind of detail impressed me. It suggested a whole life of marvelous, elaborate decadence that attracted me like a magnet. 
The only thing Doreen ever bawled me out about was bothering to get my assignments in by a deadline. 
"What are you sweating over that for?" Doreen lounged on my bed in a peach silk dressing gown, filing her long, nicotine-yellow nails with an emery board, while I typed up the draft of an interview with a best-selling novelist. 
That was another thing -- the rest of us had starched cotton summer nighties and quilted housecoats, or maybe terrycloth robes that doubled as beachcoats, but Doreen wore these full-length nylon and lace jobs you could half see through, and dressing gowns the color of skin, that stuck to her by some kind of electricity. She had an interesting, slightly sweaty smell that reminded me of those scallopy leaves of sweet fern you break off and crush between your fingers for the musk of them. 
"You know old Jay Cee won't give a damn if that story's in tomorrow or Monday." Doreen lit a cigarette and let the smoke flare slowly from her nostrils so her eyes were veiled. "Jay Cee's ugly as sin," Doreen went on coolly. "I bet that old husband of hers turns out all the lights before he gets near her or he'd puke otherwise." 
Jay Cee was my boss, and I liked her a lot, in spite of what Doreen said. She wasn't one of the fashion magazine gushers with fake eyelashes and giddy jewelry. Jay Cee had brains, so her plug-ugly looks didn't seem to matter. She read a couple of languages and knew all the quality writers in the business. 
I tried to imagine Jay Cee out of her strict office suit and luncheon-duty hat and in bed with her fat husband, but I just couldn't do it. I always had a terribly hard time trying to imagine people in bed together. 
Jay Cee wanted to teach me something, all the old ladies I ever knew wanted to teach me something, but I suddenly didn't think they had anything to teach me. I fitted the lid on my typewriter and clicked it shut.  
Doreen grinned. "Smart girl."  
Somebody tapped at the door.  
"Who is it?" I didn't bother to get up.  
"It's me, Betsy. Are you coming to the party?"  
"I guess so." I still didn't go to the door.  
They imported Betsy straight from Kansas with her bouncing blonde ponytail and Sweetheart-of-Sigma-Chi smile. I remember once the two of us were called over to the office of some blue-chinned TV producer in a pin-stripe suit to see if we had any angles he could build up for a program, and Betsy started to tell about the male and female corn in Kansas. She got so excited about that damn corn even the producer had tears in his eyes, only he couldn't use any of it, unfortunately, he said. 
Later on, the Beauty Editor persuaded Betsy to cut her hair and made a cover girl out of her, and I still see her fare now and then, smiling out of those "P.Q.'s wife wears 
B.H. Wragge" ads. 
Betsy was always asking me to do things with her and the other girls as if she were trying to save me in some way. She never asked Doreen. In private, Doreen called her Pollyanna Cowgirl. 
"Do you want to come in our cab?" Betsy said through the door. 
Doreen shook her head. 

"That's all right, Betsy," I said. "I'm going with Doreen." 
"Okay." I could hear Betsy padding off down the hall. 
"We'll just go till we get sick of it," Doreen told me, stubbing out her cigarette in the base of my bedside reading lamp, "then we'll go out on the town. Those parties they stage here remind me of the old dances in the school gym. Why do they always round up Yalies? They're so stoo-pit!" 
Buddy Willard went to Yale, but now I thought of it, what was wrong with him was that he was stupid. Oh, he'd managed to get good marks all right, and to have an affair with some awful waitress on the Cape by the name of Gladys, but he didn't have one speck of intuition. Doreen had intuition. Everything she said was like a secret voice speaking straight out of my own bones. 
We were stuck in the theater-hour rush. Our cab sat wedged in back of Betsy's cab and in front of a cab with four of the other girls, and nothing moved. 
Doreen looked terrific. She was wearing a strapless white lace dress zipped up over a snug corset affair that curved her in at the middle and bulged her out again spectacularly above and below, and her skin had a bronzy polish under the pale dusting powder. She smelled strong as a whole perfume store. 
I wore a black shantung sheath that cost me forty dollars. It was part of a buying spree I had with some of my scholarship money when I heard I was one of the lucky ones going to New York. This dress was cut so queerly I couldn't wear any sort of a bra under it, but that didn't matter much as I was skinny as a boy and barely rippled, and I liked feeling almost naked on the hot summer nights. 
The city had faded my tan, though. I looked yellow as a Chinaman. Ordinarily, I would have been nervous about my dress and my odd color, but being with Doreen made me forget my worries. I felt wise and cynical as all hell. 
When the man in the blue lumber shirt and black chinos and tooled leather cowboy boots started to stroll over to us from under the striped awning of the bar where he'd been eyeing our cab, I couldn't have any illusions. I knew perfectly well he'd come for Doreen. He threaded his way out between the stopped cars and leaned engagingly on the sill of our open window. 
"And what, may I ask, are two nice girls like you doing all alone in a cab on a nice night like this?" 
He had a big, wide, white toothpaste-ad smile. 
"We're on our way to a party," I blurted, since Doreen had gone suddenly dumb as a post and was fiddling in a blasÈ way with her white lace pocketbook cover. 
"That sounds boring," the man said. "Whyn't you both join me for a couple of drinks in that bar over there? I've some friends waiting as well." 
He nodded in the direction of several informally dressed men slouching around under the awning. They had been following him with their eyes, and when he glanced back at them, they burst out laughing. 
The laughter should have warned me. It was a kind of low, know-it-all snicker, but the traffic showed signs of moving again, and I knew that if I sat tight, in two seconds I'd be wishing I'd taken this gift of a chance to see something of New York besides what the people on the magazine had planned out for us so carefully. 
"How about it, Doreen?" I said. 
"How about it, Doreen?" the man said, smiling his big smile. To this day I can't remember what he looked like when he wasn't smiling. I think he must have been smiling the whole time. It must have been natural for him, smiling like that. 
"Well, all right," Doreen said to me. I opened the door, and we stepped out of the cab just as it was edging ahead again and started to walk over to the bar. 
There was a terrible shriek of brakes followed by a dull thump-thump. 
"Hey you!" Our cabby was craning out of his window with a furious, purple expression. "Waddaya think you're doin'?" 
He had stopped the cab so abruptly that the cab behind bumped smack into him, and we could see the four girls inside waving and struggling and scrambling up off the floor. 
The man laughed and left us on the curb and went back and handed a bill to the driver in the middle of a great honking and some yelling, and then we saw the girls from the magazine moving off in a row, one cab after another, like a wedding party with nothing but bridesmaids. 
"Come on, Frankie," the man said to one of his friends in the group, and a short, scrunty fellow detached himself and came into the bar with us. 
He was the type of fellow I can't stand. I'm five feet ten in my stocking feet, and when I am with little men I stoop over a bit and slouch my hips, one up and one down, so I'll look shorter, and I feel gawky and morbid as somebody in a sideshow. 
For a minute I had a wild hope we might pair off according to size, which would line me up with the man who had spoken to us in the first place, and he cleared a good six feet, but he went ahead with Doreen and didn't give me a second look. I tried to pretend I didn't see Frankie dogging along at my elbow and sat close by Doreen at the table. 
It was so dark in the bar I could hardly make out anything except Doreen. With her white hair and white dress she was so white she looked silver. I think she must have reflected the neons over the bar. I felt myself melting into the shadows like the negative of a person I'd never seen before in my life. 
"Well, what'll we have?" the man asked with a large smile.  
"I think I'll have an old-fashioned," Doreen said to me.  
Ordering drinks always floored me. I didn't know whisky from gin and never managed to get anything I really liked the taste of. Buddy Willard and the other college boys I knew were usually too poor to buy hard liquor or they scorned drinking altogether. It's amazing how many college boys don't drink or smoke. I seemed to know them all. The farthest Buddy Willard ever went was buying us a bottle of Dubonnet, which he only did because he was trying to prove he could be aesthetic in spite of being a medical student. 
"I'll have a vodka," I said. 
The man looked at me more closely. "With anything?" 
"Just plain," I said. "I always have it plain."  
I thought I might make a fool of myself by saying I'd have it with ice or gin or anything. I'd seen a vodka ad once, just a glass full of vodka standing in the middle of a snowdrift in a blue light, and the vodka looked clear and pure as water, so I thought having vodka plain must be all right. My dream was someday ordering a drink and finding out it tasted wonderful. 
The waiter came up then, and the man ordered drinks for the four of us. He looked so at home in that citified bar in his ranch outfit I thought he might well be somebody famous. 
Doreen wasn't saying a word, she only toyed with her cork placemat and 
eventually lit a cigarette, but the man didn't seem to mind. He kept staring at her the way 
people stare at the great white macaw in the zoo, waiting for it to say something human. 
The drinks arrived, and mine looked clear and pure, just like the vodka ad. 

"What do you do?" I asked the man, to break the silence shooting up around me on all sides, thick as jungle grass. "I mean what do you do here in New York?" 
Slowly and with what seemed a great effort, the man dragged his eyes away from Doreen's shoulder. "I'm a disc jockey," he said. "You prob'ly must have heard of me. The name's Lenny Shepherd." 
"I know you," Doreen said suddenly. 
"I'm glad about that, honey," the man said, and burst out laughing. "That'll come in handy. I'm famous as hell."  
Then Lenny Shepherd gave Frankie a long look. 
"Say, where do you come from?" Frankie asked, sitting up with a jerk. "What's your name?" 
"This here's Doreen." Lenny slid his hand around Doreen's bare arm and gave her a squeeze. 
What surprised me was that Doreen didn't let on she noticed what he was doing. She just sat there, dusky as a bleached-blonde Negress in her white dress, and sipped daintily at her drink. 
"My name's Elly Higginbottom," I said. "I come from Chicago." After that I felt safer. I didn't want anything I said or did that night to be associated with me and my real name and coming from Boston. 
"Well, Elly, what do you say we dance some?" 
The thought of dancing with that little runt in his orange suede elevator shoes and mingy T-shirt and droopy blue sports coat made me laugh. If there's anything I look down on, it's a man in a blue outfit. Black or gray, or brown, even. Blue makes me laugh. 
"I'm not in the mood," I said coldly, turning my back on him and hitching my chair over nearer to Doreen and Lenny. 
Those two looked as if they'd known each other for years by now. Doreen was spooning up the hunks of fruit at the bottom of her glass with a spindly silver spoon, and Lenny was grunting each time she lifted the spoon to her mouth, and snapping and pretending to be a dog or something, and trying to get the fruit off the spoon. Doreen giggled and kept spooning up the fruit. 
I began to think vodka was my drink at last. It didn't taste like anything, but it went straight down into my stomach like a sword swallower's sword and made me feel powerful and godlike. 
"I better go now," Frankie said, standing up. 
I couldn't see him very clearly, the place was so dim, but for the first time I heard what a high, silly voice he had. Nobody paid him any notice. 
"Hey, Lenny, you owe me something. Remember, Lenny, you owe me something, don't you, Lenny?" 
I thought it odd Frankie should be reminding Lenny he owed him something in front of us, and we being perfect strangers, but Frankie stood there saying the same thing over and over until Lenny dug into his pocket and pulled out a big roll of green bills and 
peeled one off and handed it to Frankie. I think it was ten dollars. 
"Shut up and scram." 
For a minute I thought Lenny was talking to me as well, but then I heard Doreen say, "I won't come unless Elly comes." I had to hand it to her the way she picked up my fake name. 
"Oh, Elly'll come, won't you, Elly?" Lenny said, giving me a wink. 
"Sure I'll come," I said. Frankie had wilted away into the night, so I thought I'd string along with Doreen. I wanted to see as much as I could. 
I liked looking on at other people in crucial situations. If there was a road accident or a street fight or a baby pickled in a laboratory jar for me to look at, I'd stop and look so hard I never forgot it. 
I certainly learned a lot of things I never would have learned otherwise this way, and even when they surprised me or made me sick I never let on, but pretended that's the way I knew things were all the time. 
Two 
I wouldn't have missed Lenny's place for anything. 
It was built exactly like the inside of a ranch, only in the middle of a New York apartment house. He'd had a few partitions knocked down to make the place broaden out, he said, and then had them pine-panel the walls and fit up a special pine-paneled bar in the shape of a horseshoe. I think the floor was pine-paneled, too. 
Great white bearskins lay about underfoot, and the only furniture was a lot of low beds covered with Indian rugs. Instead of pictures hung up on the walls, he had antlers and buffalo horns and a stuffed rabbit head. Lenny jutted a thumb at the meek little gray muzzle and stiff jackrabbit ears.  
"Ran over that in Las Vegas." 
He walked away across the room, his cowboy boots echoing like pistol shots. "Acoustics," he said, and grew smaller and smaller until he vanished through a door in the distance. 
All at once music started to come out of the air on every side. Then it stopped, and we heard Lenny's voice say "This is your twelve o'clock disc jock, Lenny Shepherd, with a roundup of the tops in pops. Number Ten in the wagon train this week is none other than that little yaller-haired gal you been hearin' so much about lately. . . the one an' only Sunflower!" 
I was born in Kansas, I was bred in Kansas, 
And when I marry I'll be wed in Kansas. . . 

"What a card!" Doreen said "Isn't he a card?" 
"You bet," I said. 

"Listen, Elly, do me a favor." She seemed to think Elly was who I really was by now. 
 "Sure," I said. 
"Stick around, will you? I wouldn't have a chance if he tried anything funny. Did you see that muscle?" Doreen giggled. 
Lenny popped out of the back room. "I got twenty grand's worth of recording equipment in there." He ambled over to the bar and set out three glasses and a silver ice bucket and a big pitcher and began to mix drinks from several different bottles. 
. . .to a true-blue gal who promised she would wait --
She's the sunflower of the Sunflower State. 
"Terrific, huh?" Lenny came over, balancing three glasses. Big drops stood out on them like sweat, and the ice cubes jingled as he passed them around. Then the music twanged to a stop, and we heard Lenny's voice announcing the next number. 
"Nothing like listening to yourself talk. Say," Lenny's eye lingered on me, "Frankie vamoosed, you ought to have somebody, I'll call up one of the fellers." 
"That's okay," I said. "You don't have to do that." I didn't want to come straight out and ask for somebody several sizes larger than Frankie. 
Lenny looked relieved. "Just so's you don't mind. I wouldn't want to do wrong by a friend of Doreen's." He gave Doreen a big white smile. "Would I, honeybun?" 
He held out a hand to Doreen, and without a word they both started to jitterbug, still hanging onto their glasses. 
I sat cross-legged on one of the beds and tried to look devout and impassive like some businessmen I once saw watching an Algerian belly dancer, but as soon as I leaned back against the wall under the stuffed rabbit, the bed started to roll out into the room, so I sat down on a bearskin on the floor and leaned back against the bed instead. 
My drink was wet and depressing. Each time I took another sip it tasted more and mere like dead water. Around the middle of the glass there was painted a pink lasso with yellow polka dots. I drank to about an inch below the lasso and waited a bit, and when I went to take another sip, the drink was up to lasso-level again. 
Out of the air Lenny's voice boomed, "Wye oh wye did I ever leave Wyoming?" 
The two of them didn't even stop jitterbugging during the intervals. I felt myself shrinking to a small black dot against all those red and white rugs and that pine paneling. I felt like a hole in the ground. 
There is something demoralizing about watching two people get more and more crazy about each other, especially when you are the only extra person in the room. 
It's like watching Paris from an express caboose heading in the opposite direction -- every second the city gets smaller and smaller, only you feel it's really you getting smaller and smaller and lonelier and lonelier, rushing away from all those lights and that excitement at about a million miles an hour. 
Every so often Lenny and Doreen would bang into each other and kiss and then swing to take a long drink and close in on each other again. I thought I might just lie down on the bearskin and go to sleep until Doreen felt ready to go back to the hotel. 
Then Lenny gave a terrible roar. I sat up. Doreen was hanging on to Lenny's left ear lobe with her teeth. 
"Leggo, you bitch!" 
Lenny stooped, and Doreen went flying up on to his shoulder, and her glass sailed out of her hand in a long, wide arc and fetched up against the pine paneling with a silly tinkle. Lenny was still roaring and whirling round so fast I couldn't see Doreen's face. 
I noted, in the routine way you notice the color of somebody's eyes, that Doreen's breasts had popped out of her dress and were swinging out slightly like full brown melons as she circled belly-down on Lenny's shoulder, thrashing her legs in the air and screeching, and then they both started to laugh and slow up, and Lenny was trying to bite Doreen's hip through her skirt when I let myself out the door before anything more could happen and managed to get downstairs by leaning with both hands on the banister and half sliding the whole way. 
I didn't realize Lenny's place had been air-conditioned until I wavered out onto the pavement. The tropical, stale heat the sidewalks had been sucking up all day hit me in the face like a last insult. I didn't know where in the world I was. 
For a minute I entertained the idea of taking a cab to the party after all, but decided against it because the dance might be over by now, and I didn't feel like ending up in an empty barn of a ballroom strewn with confetti and cigarette butts and crumpled cocktail napkins. 
I walked carefully to the nearest street corner, brushing the wall of the buildings on my left with the tip of one finger to steady myself. I looked at the street sign. Then I took my New York street map out of my pocketbook. I was exactly forty-three blocks by five blocks away from my hotel 
Walking has never fazed me. I just set out in the right direction, counting the blocks under my breath, and when I walked into the lobby of the hotel I was perfectly sober and my feet only slightly swollen, but that was my own fault because I hadn't bothered to wear any stockings. 
The lobby was empty except for a night clerk dozing in his lit booth among the key rings and the silent telephones. 
I slid into the self-service elevator and pushed the button for my floor. The doors folded shut like a noiseless accordion. Then my ears went funny, and I noticed a big, smudgy-eyed Chinese woman staring idiotically into my face. It was only me, of course. I was appalled to see how wrinkled and used up I looked. 
There wasn't a soul in the hall. I let myself into my room. It was full of smoke. At first I thought the smoke had materialized out of thin air as a sort of judgment, but then I remembered it was Doreen's smoke and pushed the button that opened the window vent. They had the windows fixed so you couldn't really open them and lean out, and for some reason this made me furious. 
By standing at the left side of the window and laying my cheek to the woodwork, I could see downtown to where the UN balanced itself in the dark, like a weird green Martian honeycomb. I could see the moving red and white lights along the drive and the lights of the bridges whose names I didn't know. 
The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence. 
I knew perfectly well the cars were making noise, and the people in them and behind the lit windows of the buildings were making a noise, and the river was making a nowise, but I couldn't hear a thing. The city hung in my window, flat as a poster, glittering and blinking, but it might just as well not have been there at all, for all the good it did me. 
The china-white bedside telephone could have connected me up with things, but there it sat, dumb as a death's head. I tried to think of people I'd given my phone number to, so I could make a list of all the possible calls I might be about to receive, but all I could think of was that I'd given my phone number to Buddy Willard's mother so she could give it to a simultaneous interpreter she knew at the UN. 
I let out a small, dry laugh. 
I could imagine the sort of simultaneous interpreter Mrs. Willard would introduce me to when all the time she wanted me to marry Buddy, who was taking the cure for TB somewhere in upper New York State. Buddy's mother had even arranged for me to be given a job as a waitress at the TB sanatorium that summer so Buddy wouldn't be lonely. She and Buddy couldn't understand why I chose to go to New York City instead. 
The mirror over my bureau seemed slightly warped and much too silver. The face in it looked like the reflection in a ball of dentist's mercury. I thought of crawling in between the bed sheets and trying to sleep, but that appealed to me about as much as stuffing a dirty, scrawled-over letter into a fresh, clean envelope. I decided to take a hot bath. 
There must be quite a few things a hot bath won't cure, but I don't know many of them. Whenever I'm sad I'm going to die, or so nervous I can't sleep, or in love with somebody I won't be seeing for a week, I slump down just so far and then I say: "I'll go take a hot bath." 
I meditate in the bath. The water needs to be very hot, so hot you can barely stand putting your foot in it. Then you lower yourself, inch by inch, till the water's up to your neck. 
I remember the ceiling over every bathtub I've stretched out in. I remember the texture of the ceilings and the cracks and the colors and the damp spots and the light fixtures. I remember the tubs, too: the antique griffin-legged tubs, and the modern coffin-shaped tubs, and the fancy pink marble tubs overlooking indoor lily ponds, and I remember the shapes and sizes of the water taps and the different sorts of soap holders. 
I never feel so much myself as when I'm in a hot bath. 
I lay in that tub on the seventeenth floor of this hotel for-women-only, high up over the jazz and push of New York, for near onto an hour, and I felt myself growing pure again. I don't believe in baptism or the waters of Jordan or anything like that, but I guess I feel about a hot bath the way those religious people feel about holy water. 
I said to myself: "Doreen is dissolving, Lenny Shepherd is dissolving, Frankie is dissolving, New York is dissolving, they are all dissolving away and none of them matter any more. I don't know them, I have never known them and I am very pure. All that liquor and those sticky kisses I saw and the dirt that settled on my skin on the way back is turning into something pure." 
The longer I lay there in the clear hot water the purer I felt, and when I stepped out at last and wrapped myself in one of the big, soft white hotel bath towels I felt pure and sweet as a new baby. 
I don't know how long I had been asleep when I heard the knocking. I didn't pay any attention at first, because the person knocking kept saying, "Elly, Elly, Elly, let me in," and I didn't know any Elly. Then another kind of knock sounded over the first dull, bumping knock-a sharp tap-tap, and another, much crisper voice said, "Miss Greenwood, your friend wants you," and I knew it was Doreen. 
I swung to my feet and balanced dizzily for a minute in the middle of the dark room. I felt angry with Doreen for waking me up. All I stood a chance of getting out of that sad night was a good sleep, and she had to wake me up and spoil it. I thought if I pretended to be asleep the knocking might go away and leave me in peace, but I waited, and it didn't. 
"Elly, Elly, Elly," the first voice mumbled, while the other voice went on hissing, "Miss Greenwood, Miss Greenwood, Miss Greenwood," as if I had a split personality or something. 
I opened the door and blinked out into the bright hall. I had the impression it wasn't night and it wasn't day, but some lurid third interval that had suddenly slipped between them and would never end. 
Doreen was slumped against the doorjamb. When I came out, she toppled into my arms. I couldn't see her face because her head was hanging down on her chest and her stiff blonde hair fell down from its dark roots like a hula fringe. 
I recognized the short, squat, mustached woman in the black uniform as the night maid who ironed day dresses and party frocks in a crowded cubicle on our floor. I couldn't understand how she came to know Doreen or why she should want to help Doreen wake me up instead of leading her quietly back to her own room. 
Seeing Doreen supported in my arms and silent except for a few wet hiccups, the woman strode away down the hall to her cubicle with its ancient Singer sewing machine and white ironing board. I wanted to run after her and tell her I had nothing to do with Doreen, because she looked stern and hardworking and moral as an old-style European immigrant and reminded me of my Austrian grandmother. 
"Lemme lie down, lemme lie down," Doreen was muttering. "Lemme lie down, lemme lie down." 
I felt if I carried Doreen across the threshold into my room and helped her onto my bed I would never get rid of her again. 
Her body was warm and soft as a pile of pillows against my arm where she leaned her weight, and her feet, in their high, spiked heels, dragged foolishly. She was much too heavy for me to budge down the long hall. 
I decided the only thing to do was to dump her on the carpet and shut and lock my door and go back to bed. When Doreen woke up she wouldn't remember what had happened and would think she must have passed out in front of my door while I slept, and she would get up of her own accord and go sensibly back to her room. 
I started to lower Doreen gently onto the green hall carpet, but she gave a low moan and pitched forward out of my arms. A jet of brown vomit flew from her mouth and spread in a large puddle at my feet. 
Suddenly Doreen grew even heavier. Her head drooped forward into the puddle, the wisps of her blonde hair dabbling in it like tree roots in a bog, and I realized she was asleep. I drew back. I felt half-asleep myself. 
I made a decision about Doreen that night. I decided I would watch her and listen to what she said, but deep down I would have nothing at all to do with her. Deep down, I would be loyal to Betsy and her innocent friends. It was Betsy I resembled at heart. 
Quietly, I stepped back into my room and shut the door. On second thought, I didn't lock it. I couldn't quite bring myself to do that. 
When I woke up in the dull, sunless heat the next morning, I dressed and splashed my face with cold water and put on some lipstick and opened the door slowly. I think I still expected to see Doreen's body lying there in the pool of vomit like an ugly, concrete testimony to my own dirty nature. 
There was nobody in the hall. The carpet stretched from one end of the hall to the other, clean and eternally verdant except for a faint, irregular dark stain before my door as if somebody had by accident spilled a glass of water there, but dabbed it dry again. 

Three
 ARRAYED ON THE Ladies Day banquet table were yellow-green avocado pear halves stuffed with crabmeat and mayonnaise, and platters of rare roast beef and cold chicken, and every so often a cut-glass bowl heaped with black caviar. I hadn't had time to eat any breakfast at the hotel cafeteria that morning, except for a cup of overstewed coffee so bitter it made my nose curl, and I was starving. 
Before I came to New York I'd never eaten out in a proper restaurant. I don't count Howard Johnson's, where I only had french fries and cheeseburgers and vanilla frappes with people like Buddy Willard. I'm not sure why it is, but I love food more than just about anything else. No matter how much I eat, I never put on weight. With one exception I've been the same weight for ten years. 
My favorite dishes are full of butter and cheese and sour cream. In New York we had so many free luncheons with people on the magazine and various visiting celebrities I developed the habit of running my eye down those huge handwritten menus, where a tiny side dish of peas cost fifty or sixty cents, until I'd picked the richest, most expensive dishes and ordered a string of them. 
We were always taken out on expense accounts, so I never felt guilty. I made a point of eating so fast I never kept the other people waiting who generally ordered only chef's salad and grapefruit juice because they were trying to reduce. Almost everybody I met in New York was trying to reduce. 
"I want to welcome the prettiest, smartest bunch of young ladies our staff has yet had the good luck to meet," the plump, bald master-of-ceremonies wheezed into his lapel microphone. "This banquet is just a small sample of the hospitality our Food Testing Kitchens here on Ladies' Day would like to offer in appreciation for your visit." 
A delicate, ladylike spatter of applause, and we all sat at the enormous linen-draped table. 
There were eleven of us girls from the magazine, together with most of our supervising editors, and the whole staff of the Ladies' Day Food Testing Kitchens in hygienic white smocks, neat hairnets and flawless makeup of a uniform peach-pie color. 
There were only eleven of us, because Doreen was missing. They had set her place next to mine for some reason, and the chair stayed empty. I saved her placecard for her -- a pocket mirror with "Doreen" painted along the top of it in lacy script and a wreath of frosted daisies around the edge, framing the silver hole where her face would show. 
Doreen was spending the day with Lenny Shepherd. She spent most of her free time with Lenny Shepherd now. 
In the hour before our luncheon at Ladies' Day -- the big women's magazine that features lush double-page spreads of Technicolor meals, with a different theme and locale each month -- we had been shown around the endless glossy kitchens and seen how difficult it is to photograph apple pie a la mode under bright lights because the ice cream keeps melting and has to be propped up from behind with toothpicks and changed every time it starts looking too soppy. 
The sight of all the food stacked in those kitchens made me dizzy. It's not that we hadn't enough to eat at home, it's just that my grandmother always cooked economy joints and economy meat loafs and had the habit of saying, the minute you lifted the first forkful to your mouth, "I hope you enjoy that, it cost forty-one cents a pound," which always made me feel I was somehow eating pennies instead of Sunday roast. 
While we were standing up behind our chairs listening to the welcome speech, I had bowed my head and secretly eyed the position of the bowls of caviar. One bowl was set strategically between me and Doreen's empty chair. 
I figured the girl across from me couldn't reach it because of the mountainous centerpiece of marzipan fruit, and Betsy, on my right, would be too nice to ask me to share it with her if I just kept it out of the way at my elbow by my bread-and-butter plate. Besides, another bowl of caviar sat a little way to the right of the girl next to Betsy, and she could eat that. 
My grandfather and I had a standing joke. He was the head waiter at a country club near my home town, and every Sunday my grandmother drove in to bring him home for his Monday off. My brother and I alternated going with her, and my grandfather always served Sunday supper to my grandmother and whichever of us was along as if we were regular club guests. He loved introducing me to special tidbits, and by the age of nine I had developed a passionate taste for cold vichyssoise and caviar and anchovy paste. 
The joke was that at my wedding my grandfather would see I had all the caviar I could eat. It was a joke because I never intended to get married, and even if I did, my grandfather couldn't have afforded enough caviar unless he robbed the country club kitchen and carried it off in a suitcase. 
Under cover of the clinking of water goblets and silverware and bone china, I paved my plate with chicken slices. Then I covered the chicken slices with caviar thickly as if I were spreading peanut butter on a piece of bread. Then I picked up the chicken slices in my fingers one by one, rolled them so the caviar wouldn't ooze off and ate them. 
I'd discovered, after a lot of extreme apprehension about what spoons to use, that if you do something incorrect at table with a certain arrogance, as if you knew perfectly well you were doing it properly, you can get away with it and nobody will think you are bad-mannered or poorly brought up. They will think you are original and very witty. 
I learned this trick the day Jay Cee took me to lunch with a famous poet. He wore a horrible, lumpy, speckled brown tweed jacket and gray pants and a red-and-blue checked open-throated jersey in a very formal restaurant full of fountains and chandeliers, where all the other men were dressed in dark suits and immaculate white shirts. 
This poet ate his salad with his fingers, leaf by leaf, while talking to me about the antithesis of nature and art. I couldn't take my eyes off the pale, stubby white fingers traveling back and forth from the poet's salad bowl to the poet's mouth with one dripping lettuce leaf after another. Nobody giggled or whispered rude remarks. The poet made eating salad with your fingers seem to be the only natural and sensible thing to do. 
None of our magazine editors or the Ladies' Day staff members sat anywhere near me, and Betsy seemed sweet and friendly, she didn't even seem to like caviar, so I grew more and more confident. When I finished my first plate of cold chicken and caviar, I laid out another. Then I tackled the avocado and crabmeat salad. 
Avocados are my favorite fruit. Every Sunday my grandfather used to bring me an avocado pear hidden at the bottom of his briefcase under six soiled shirts and the Sunday comics. He taught me how to eat avocados by melting grape jelly and french dressing together in a saucepan and filling the cup of the pear with the garnet sauce. I felt homesick for that sauce. The crabmeat tasted bland in comparison. 
"How was the fur show?" I asked Betsy, when I was no longer worried about competition over my caviar. I scraped the last few salty black eggs from the dish with my soup spoon and licked it clean. 
"It was wonderful," Betsy smiled. "They showed us how to make an all-purpose neckerchief out of mink tails and a gold chain, the sort of chain you can get an exact copy of at Woolworth's for a dollar ninety-eight, and Hilda nipped down to the wholesale fur warehouses right afterward and bought a bunch of mink tails at a big discount and dropped in at Woolworth's and then stitched the whole thing together coming up on the bus." 
I peered over at Hilda, who sat on the other side of Betsy. Sure enough, she was wearing an expensive-looking scarf of furry tails fastened on one side by a dangling gilt chain. 
I never really understood Hilda. She was six feet tall, with huge, slanted green eyes and thick red lips and a vacant, Slavic expression. She made hats. She was apprenticed to the Fashion Editor, which set her apart from the more literary ones among us like Doreen and Betsy and I myself, who all wrote columns, even if some of them were only about health and beauty. I don't know if Hilda could read, but she made startling hats. She went to a special school for making hats in New York and every day she wore a new hat to work, constructed by her own hands out of bits of straw or fur or ribbon or veiling in subtle shades. 
"That's amazing," I said. "Amazing." I missed Doreen. She would have murmured some fine, scalding remark about Hilda's miraculous furpiece to cheer me up. 
I felt very low. I had been unmasked only that morning by Jay Cee herself, and I felt now that all the uncomfortable suspicions I had about myself were coming true, and I couldn't hide the truth much longer. After nineteen years of running after good marks and prizes and grants of one sort and another, I was letting up, slowing down, dropping clean out of the race. 
"Why didn't you come along to the fur show with us?" Betsy asked. I had the impression she was repeating herself, and that she'd asked me the same question a minute ago, only I couldn't have been listening. "Did you go off with Doreen?" 
"No," I said, "I wanted to go to the fur show, but Jay Cee called up and made me come into the office." That wasn't quite true about wanting to go to the show, but I tried to convince myself now that it was true, so I could be really wounded about what Jay Cee had done. 
I told Betsy how I had been lying in bed that morning planning to go to the fur show. What I didn't tell her was that Doreen had come into my room earlier and said, "What do you want to go to that assy show for, Lenny and I are going to Coney Island, so why don't you come along? Lenny can get you a nice fellow, the day's shot to hell anyhow with that luncheon and then the film premiËre in the afternoon, so nobody'll miss us." 
For a minute I was tempted. The show certainly did seem stupid. I have never cared for furs. What I decided to do in the end was lie in bed as long as I wanted to and then go to Central Park and spend the day lying in the grass, the longest grass I could find in that bald, duck-ponded wilderness. 
I told Doreen I would not go to the show or the luncheon or the film premiËre, but that I would not go to Coney Island either, I would stay in bed. After Doreen left, I wondered why I couldn't go the whole way doing what I should any more. This made me sad and tired. Then I wondered why I couldn't go the whole way doing what I shouldn't, the way Doreen did, and this made me even sadder and more tired. 
I didn't know what time it was, but I'd heard the girls bustling and calling in the hall and getting ready for the fur show, and then I'd heard the hall go still, and as I lay on my back in bed staring up at the blank, white ceiling the stillness seemed to grow bigger and bigger until I felt my eardrums would burst with it. Then the phone rang. 
I stared at the phone for a minute. The receiver shook a bit in its bone-colored cradle, so I could tell it was really ringing. I thought I might have given my phone number to somebody at a dance or a party and then forgotten about it. I lifted the receiver and spoke in a husky, receptive voice. 
 "Hello?" 
"Jay Cee here," Jay Cee rapped out with brutal promptitude. "I wondered if you happened to be planning to come into the office today?" 
I sank down into the sheets. I couldn't understand why Jay Cee thought I'd be coming into the office. We had these mimeographed schedule cards so we could keep track of all our activities, and we spent a lot of mornings and afternoons away from the office going to affairs in town. Of course, some of the affairs were optional. 
There was quite a pause. Then I said meekly, "I thought I was going to the fur show." Of course I hadn't thought any such thing, but I couldn't figure out what else to say. 
"I told her I thought I was going to the fur show," I said to Betsy. "But she told me to come into the office, she wanted to have a little talk with me, and there was some work to do." 
"Oh-oh!" Betsy said sympathetically. She must have seen the tears that plopped down into my dessert dish of meringue and brandy ice cream, because she pushed over her own untouched dessert and I started absently on that when I'd finished my own. I felt a bit awkward about the tears, but they were real enough. Jay Cee had said some terrible things to me. 
When I made my wan entrance into the office at about ten o'clock, Jay Cee stood up and came round her desk to shut the door, and I sat in the swivel chair in front of my typewriter table facing her, and she sat in the swivel chair behind her desk facing me, with the window full of potted plants, shelf after shelf of them, springing up at her back like a tropical garden. 
"Doesn't your work interest you, Esther?" 
"Oh, it does, it does," I said. "It interests me very much." I felt like yelling the words, as if that might make them more convincing, but I controlled myself. 
All my life I'd told myself studying and reading and writing and working like mad was what I wanted to do, and it actually seemed to be true, I did everything well enough and got all A's, and by the time I made it to college nobody could stop me. 
I was college correspondent for the town Gazette and editor of the literary magazine and secretary of Honor Board, which deals with academic and social offenses and punishments -- a popular office -- and I had a well-known woman poet and professor on the faculty championing me for graduate school at the biggest universities in the east, and promises of full scholarships all the way, and now I was apprenticed to the best editor on an intellectual fashion magazine, and what did I do but balk and balk like a dull cart horse? 
"I'm very interested in everything." The words fell with a hollow flatness on to Jay Cee's desk, like so many wooden nickels. 
"I'm glad of that," Jay Cee said a bit waspishly. "You can learn a lot in this month on the magazine, you know, if you just roll up your shirtsleeves. The girl who was here before you didn't bother with any of the fashion-show stuff. She went straight from this office on to Time." 
"My!" I said, in the same sepulchral tone. "That was quick!" 
"Of course, you have another year at college yet," Jay Cee went on a little more mildly. "What do you have in mind after you graduate?" 
What I always thought I had in mind was getting some big scholarship to graduate school or a grant to study all over Europe, and then I thought I'd be a professor and write books of poems or write books of poems and be an editor of some sort. Usually I had these plans on the tip of my tongue. 
"I don't really know," I heard myself say. I felt a deep shock, hearing myself say that, because the minute I said it, I knew it was true. 
It sounded true, and I recognized it, the way you recognize some nondescript person that's been hanging around your door for ages and then suddenly comes up and introduces himself as your real father and looks exactly like you, so you know he really is your father, and the person you thought all your life was your father is a sham. 
"I don't really know." 
"You'll never get anywhere like that." Jay Cee paused. "What languages do you have?" 
"Oh, I can read a bit of French, I guess, and I've always wanted to learn German." I'd been telling people I'd always wanted to learn German for about five years. 
My mother spoke German during her childhood in America and was stoned for it during the First World War by the children at school. My German-speaking father, dead since I was nine, came from some manic-depressive hamlet in the black heart of Prussia. My youngest brother was at that moment on the Experiment in International Living in Berlin and speaking German like a native. 
What I didn't say was that each time I picked up a German dictionary or a German book, the very sight of those dense, black, barbed-wire letters made my mind shut like a clam. 
"I've always thought I'd like to go into publishing." I tried to recover a thread that might lead me back to my old, bright salesmanship. "I guess what I'll do is apply at some publishing house." 
"You ought to read French and German," Jay Cee said mercilessly, "and probably several other languages as well, Spanish and Italian -- better still, Russian, Hundreds of girls flood into New York every June thinking they'll be editors. You need to offer something more than the run-of-the-mill person. You better learn some languages." 
I hadn't the heart to tell Jay Cee there wasn't one scrap of space on my senior year schedule to learn languages in. I was taking one of those honors programs that teach you to think independently, and except for a course in Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and a seminar in advanced poetry composition, I would spend my whole time writing on some obscure theme in the works of James Joyce. I hadn't picked out my theme yet, because I hadn't got round to reading Finnegans Wake, but my professor was very excited about my thesis and had promised to give me some leads on images about twins. 
"I'll see what I can do," I told Jay Cee. "I probably might just fit in one of those double-barreled accelerated courses in elementary German they've rigged up." I thought at the time I might actually do this. I had a way of persuading my Class Dean to let me do irregular things. She regarded me as a sort of interesting experiment. 
At college I had to take a required course in physics and chemistry. I had already taken a course in botany and done very well. I never answered one test question wrong the whole year, and for a while I toyed with the idea of being a botanist and studying the wild grasses in Africa or the South American rain forests, because you can win big grants to study offbeat things like that in queer areas much more easily than winning grants to study art in Italy or English in England; there's not so much competition. 
Botany was fine, because I loved cutting up leaves and putting them under the microscope and drawing diagrams of bread mold and the odd, heart-shaped leaf in the sex cycle of the fern, it seemed so real to me. 
The day I went into physics class it was death. 
A short dark man with a high lisping voice, named Mr. Manzi, stood in front of the class in a tight blue suit holding a little wooden ball. He put the ball on a steep grooved slide and let it run down to the bottom. Then he started talking about let a equal acceleration and let t equal time and suddenly he was scribbling letters and numbers and equals signs all over the blackboard and my mind went dead. 
I took the physics book back to my dormitory. It was a huge book on porous mimeographed paper -- four hundred pages long with no drawings or photographs, only diagrams and formulas -- between brick-red cardboard covers. This book was written by Mr. Manzi to explain physics to college girls, and if it worked on us he would try to have it published. 
Well, I studied those formulas, I went to class and watched balls roll down slides and listened to bells ring and by the end of the semester most of the other girls had failed and I had a straight A. I heard Mr. Manzi saying to a bunch of the girls who were complaining that the course was too hard, "No, it can't be too hard, because one girl got a straight A." "Who is it? Tell us," they said, but he shook his head and didn't say anything and gave me a sweet little conspiring smile. 
That's what gave me the idea of escaping the next semester of chemistry. I may have made a straight A in physics, but I was panic-struck. Physics made me sick the whole time I learned it. What I couldn't stand was this shrinking everything into letters and numbers. Instead of leaf shapes and enlarged diagrams of the holes the leaves breathe through and fascinating words like carotene and xanthophyll on the blackboard, there were these hideous, cramped, scorpion-lettered formulas in Mr. Manzi's special red chalk 
I knew chemistry would be worse, because I'd seen a big chart of the ninety-odd elements hung up in the chemistry lab, and all the perfectly good words like gold and silver and cobalt and aluminum were shortened to ugly abbreviations with different decimal numbers after them. If I had to strain my brain with any more of that stuff I would go mad. I would fail outright. It was only by a horrible effort of will that I had dragged myself through the first half of the year. 
So I went to my Class Dean with a clever plan. 
My plan was that I needed the time to take a course in Shakespeare, since I was, after all, an English major. She knew and I knew perfectly well I would get a straight A again in the chemistry course, so what was the point of my taking the exams; why couldn't I just go to the classes and look on and take it all in and forget about marks or credits? It was a case of honor among honorable people, and the content meant more than the form, and marks were really a bit silly anyway, weren't they, when you knew you'd always get an A? My plan was strengthened by the fact that the college had just dropped the second year of required science for the classes after me anyway, so my class was the last to suffer under the old ruling. 
Mr. Manzi was in perfect agreement with my plan. I think it flattered him that I enjoyed his classes so much I take them for no materialistic reason like credit and an A, but for the sheer beauty of chemistry itself. I thought it was quite ingenious of me to suggest sitting in on the chemistry course even after I'd changed over to Shakespeare. It was quite an unnecessary gesture and made it seem I simply couldn't bear to give chemistry up. 
Of course, I would never have succeeded with this scheme if I hadn't made that A in the first place. And if my Class Dean had known how scared and depressed I was, and how I seriously contemplated desperate remedies such as getting a doctor's certificate that I was unfit to study chemistry, the formulas made me dizzy and so on, I'm sure she wouldn't have listened to me for a minute, but would have made me take the course regardless. 
As it happened, the Faculty Board passed my petition, and my Class Dean told me later that several of the professors were touched by it. They took it as a real step in intellectual maturity. 
I had to laugh when I thought about the rest of that year. I went to the chemistry class five times a week and didn't miss a single one. Mr. Manzi stood at the bottom of the big, rickety old amphitheater, making blue flames and red flares and clouds of yellow stuff by pouring the contents of one test tube into another, and I shut his voice out of my ears by pretending it was only a mosquito in the distance and sat back enjoying the bright lights and the colored fires and wrote page after page of villanelles and sonnets. 
Mr. Manzi would glance at me now and then and see me writing, and send up a sweet little appreciative smile. I guess he thought I was writing down all those formulas not for exam time, like the other girls, but because his presentation fascinated me so much I couldn't help it. 

Four
 I DON'T KNOW just why my successful evasion of chemistry should have floated into my mind there in Jay Cee's office. 
All the time she talked to me, I saw Mr. Manzi standing on thin air in back of Jay Cee's head, like something conjured up out of a hat, holding his little wooden ball and the test tube that billowed a great cloud of yellow smoke the day before Easter vacation and smelt of rotten eggs and made all the girls and Mr. Manzi laugh. 
I felt sorry for Mr. Manzi. I felt like going down to him on my hands and knees and apologizing for being such an awful liar. 
Jay Cee handed me a pile of story manuscripts and spoke to me much more kindly. I spent the rest of the morning reading the stories and typing out what I thought of them on the pink Interoffice Memo sheets and sending them into the office of Betsy's editor to be read by Betsy the next day. Jay Cee interrupted me now and then to tell me something practical or a bit of gossip. 
Jay Cee was going to lunch that noon with two famous writers, a man and a lady. The man had just sold six short stories to the New Yorker and six to Jay Cee. This surprised me, as I didn't know magazines bought stories in lots of six, and I was staggered by the thought of the amount of money six stories would probably bring in. Jay Cee said she had to be very careful at this lunch, because the lady writer wrote stories too, but she had never had any in the New Yorker and Jay Cee had only taken one from her in five years. Jay Cee had to flatter the more famous man at the same time as she was careful not to hurt the less famous lady. 
When the cherubs in Jay Cee's French wall clock waved their wings up and down and put their little gilt trumpets to their lips and pinged out twelve notes one after the other, Jay Cee told me I'd done enough work for the day, and to go off to the Ladies' Day tour and banquet and to the film premiËre, and she would see me bright and early tomorrow. 
Then she slipped a suit jacket over her lilac blouse, pinned a hat of imitation lilacs on the top of her head, powdered her nose briefly and adjusted her thick spectacles. She looked terrible, but very wise. As she left the office, she patted my shoulder with one lilac-gloved hand. 
"Don't let the wicked city get you down." 
I sat quietly in my swivel chair for a few minutes and thought about Jay Cee. I tried to imagine what it would be like if I were Ee Gee, the famous editor, in an office full of potted rubber plants and African violets my secretary had to water each morning. I wished I had a mother like Jay Cee. Then I'd know what to do. 
My own mother wasn't much help. My mother had taught shorthand and typing to support us ever since my father died, and secretly she hated it and hated him for dying and leaving no money because he didn't trust life insurance salesmen. She was always on to me to learn shorthand after college, so I'd have a practical skill as well as a college degree. "Even the apostles were tentmakers," she'd say. "They had to live, just the way we do." 
I dabbled my fingers in the bowl of warm water a Ladies' Day waitress set down in place of my two empty ice cream dishes. Then I wiped each finger carefully with my linen napkin which was still quite clean. Then I folded the linen napkin and laid it between my lips and brought my lips down on it precisely. When I put the napkin back on the table a fuzzy pink lip shape bloomed right in the middle of it like a tiny heart. 
I thought what a long way I had come. 
The first time I saw a fingerbowl was at the home of my benefactress. It was the custom at my college, the little freckled lady in the Scholarships Office told me, to write to the person whose scholarship you had, if they were still alive, and thank them for it 
I had the scholarship of Philomena Guinea, a wealthy novelist who went to my college in the early nineteen hundreds and had her first novel made into a silent film with Bette Davis as well as a radio serial that was still running, and it turned out she was alive and lived in a large mansion not far from my grandfather's country club. 
So I wrote Philomena Guinea a long letter in coal-black ink on gray paper with the name of the college embossed on it in red. I wrote what the leaves looked like in autumn when I bicycled out into the hills, and how wonderful it was to live on a campus instead of commuting by bus to a city college and having to live at home, and how all knowledge was opening up before me and perhaps one day I would be able to write great books the way she did. 
I had read one of Mrs. Guinea's books in the town library -- the college library didn't stock them for some reason -- and it was crammed from beginning to end with long, suspenseful questions: "Would Evelyn discern that Gladys knew Roger in her past? wondered Hector feverishly" and "How could Donald marry her when he learned of the child Elsie, hidden away with Mrs. Rollmop on the secluded country farm? Griselda demanded of her bleak, moonlit pillow." These books earned Philomena Guinea, who later told me she had been very stupid at college, millions and millions of dollars. 
Mrs. Guinea answered my letter and invited me to lunch at her home. That was where I saw my first fingerbowl. 
The water had a few cherry blossoms floating in it, and I thought it must be some clear sort of Japanese after-dinner soup and ate every bit of it, including the crisp little blossoms. Mrs. Guinea never said anything, and it was only much later, when I told a debutante I knew at college about the dinner, that I learned what I had done. 
When we came out of the sunnily lit interior of the Ladies' Day offices, the streets were gray and fuming with rain. It wasn't the nice kind of rain that rinses you clean, but the sort of rain I imagine they must have in Brazil. It flew straight down from the sky in drops the size of coffee saucers and hit the hot sidewalks with a hiss that sent clouds of steam writhing up from the gleaming, dark concrete. 
My secret hope of spending the afternoon alone in Central Park died in the glass eggbeater of Ladies' Day's revolving doors. I found myself spewed out through the warm rain and into the dim, throbbing cave of a cab, together with Betsy and Hilda and Emily Ann Offenbach, a prim little girl with a bun of red hair and a husband and three children in Teaneck, New Jersey. 
The movie was very poor. It starred a nice blonde girl who looked like June Allyson but was really somebody else, and a sexy black-haired girl who looked like Elizabeth Taylor but was also somebody else, and two big, broad-shouldered bone-heads with names like Rick and Gil. 
It was a football romance and it was in Technicolor. 
I hate Technicolor. Everybody in a Technicolor movie seems to feel obliged to wear a lurid costume in each new scene and to stand around like a clotheshorse with a lot of very green trees or very yellow wheat or very blue ocean rolling away for miles and miles in every direction. 
Most of the action in this picture took place in the football stands, with the two girls waving and cheering in smart suits with orange chrysanthemums the size of cabbages on their lapels, or in a ballroom, where the girls swooped across the floor with their dates, in dresses like something out of Gone With the Wind, and then sneaked off into the powder room to say nasty intense things to each other. 
Finally I could see the nice girl was going to end up with the nice football hero and the sexy girl was going to end up with nobody, because the man named Gil had only wanted a mistress and not a wife all along and was now packing off to Europe on a single ticket. 
At about this point I began to feel peculiar. I looked round me at all the rows of rapt little heads with the same silver glow on them at the front and the same black shadow on them at the back, and they looked like nothing more or less than a lot of stupid moonbrains. 
I felt in terrible danger of puking. I didn't know whether it was the awful movie giving me a stomachache or all that caviar I had eaten. 
"I'm going back to the hotel," I whispered to Betsy through the half-dark. 
Betsy was staring at the screen with deadly concentration. "Don't you feel good?" she whispered, barely moving her lips. 
"No," I said. "I feel like hell." 
"So do I, I'll come back with you." 
We slipped out of our seats and said Excuse me Excuse me Excuse me down the length of our row, while the people grumbled and hissed and shifted their rain boots and umbrellas to let us pass, and I stepped on as many feet as I could because it took my mind off this enormous desire to puke that was ballooning up in front of me so fast I couldn't see round it. 
The remains of a tepid rain were still sifting down when we stepped out into the street. 
Betsy looked a fright. The bloom was gone from her cheeks and her drained face floated in front of me, green and sweating. We fell into one of those yellow checkered cabs that are always waiting at the curb when you are trying to decide whether or not you want a taxi, and by the time we reached the hotel I had puked once and Betsy had puked twice. 
The cab driver took the corners with such momentum that were thrown together first on one side of the back seat and then on the other. Each time one of us felt sick, she would lean over quietly as if she had dropped something and was picking it up off the floor, and the other one would hum a little and pretend to be looking out the window. 
The cab driver seemed to know what we were doing, even so. 
"Hey," he protested, driving through a light that had just turned red, "you can't do that in my cab, you better get out and do it in the street." 
But we didn't say anything, and I guess he figured we were almost at the hotel so he didn't make us get out until we pulled up in front of the main entrance. 
We didn't dare wait to add up the fare. We stuffed a pile of silver into the cabby's hand and dropped a couple of Kleenexes to cover the mess on the floor, and ran in through the lobby and on to the empty elevator. Luckily for us, it was a quiet time of day. Betsy was sick again in the elevator and I held her head, and then I was sick and she held mine. 
Usually after a good puke you feel better right away. We hugged each other and then said good-bye and went off to opposite ends of the hall to lie down in our own rooms. There is nothing like puking with somebody to make you into old friends. 
But the minute I'd shut the door behind me and undressed and dragged myself on to the bed, I felt worse than ever. I felt I just had to go to the toilet. I struggled into my white bathrobe with the blue cornflowers on it and staggered down to the bathroom. 
Betsy was already there. I could hear her groaning behind the door, so I hurried on around the corner to the bathroom in the next wing. I thought I would die, it was so far. 
I sat on the toilet and leaned my head over the edge of the washbowl and I thought I was losing my guts and my dinner both. The sickness rolled through me in great waves. After each wave it would fade away and leave me limp as a wet leaf and shivering all over and then I would feel it rising up in me again, and the glittering white torture chamber tiles under my feet and over my head and on all four sides closed in and squeezed me to pieces. 
I don't know how long I kept at it. I let the cold water in the bowl go on running loudly with the stopper out, so anybody who came by would think I was washing my clothes, and then when I felt reasonably safe I stretched out on the floor and lay quite still. 
It didn't seem to be summer any more. I could feel the winter shaking my bones and banging my teeth together, and the big white hotel towel I had dragged down with me lay under my head numb as a snowdrift. 
I thought it very bad manners for anyone to pound on a bathroom door the way some person was pounding. They could just go around the corner and find another bathroom the way I had done and leave me in peace. But the person kept banging and pleading with me to let them in and I thought I dimly recognized the voice. It sounded a bit like Emily Ann Offenbach. 
"Just a minute," I said then. My words bungled out thick as molasses. 
I pulled myself together and slowly rose and flushed the toilet for the tenth time and sopped the bowl clean and rolled up the towel so the vomit stains didn't show very clearly and unlocked the door and stepped out into the hall. 
I knew it would be fatal if I looked at Emily Ann or anybody else so I fixed my eyes glassily on a window that swam at the end of the hall and put one foot in front of the other. 
The next thing I had a view of was somebody's shoe. 
It was a stout shoe of cracked black leather and quite old, with tiny air holes in a scalloped pattern over the toe and a dull polish, and it was pointed at me. It seemed to be placed on a hard green surface that was hurting my right cheekbone. 
I kept very still, waiting for a clue that would give me some notion of what to do. A little to the left of the shoe I saw a vague heap of blue cornflowers on a white ground and this made me want to cry. It was the sleeve of my own bathrobe I was looking at, and my left hand lay pale as a cod at the end of it. 
"She's all right now." 
The voice came from a cool, rational region far above my head. For a minute I didn't think there was anything strange about it, and then I thought it was strange. It was a man's voice, and no men were allowed to be in our hotel at any time of the night or day. 
"How many others are there?" the voice went on. 
I listened with interest. The floor seemed wonderfully solid. It was comforting to know I had fallen and could fall no farther. 
"Eleven, I think," a woman's voice answered. I figured she must belong to the black shoe. "I think there's eleven more of 'um, but one's missin' so there's oney ten." 
"Well, you get this one to bed and I'll take care of the rest." 
I heard a hollow boomp boomp in my right ear that grew fainter and fainter. Then a door opened in the distance and there were voices and groans, and the door shut again. 
Two hands slid under my armpits and the woman's voice said, "Come, come, lovey, we'll make it yet," and I felt myself being half lifted, and slowly the doors began to move by, one by one, until we came to an open door and went in. 
The sheet on my bed was folded back, and the woman helped me lie down and covered me up to the chin and rested for a minute in the bedside armchair, fanning herself with one plump, pink hand. She wore gilt-rimmed spectacles and a white nurse's cap. 
"Who are you?" I asked in a fault voice. 
"I'm the hotel nurse." 
"What's the matter with me?" 
"Poisoned," she said briefly. "Poisoned, the whole lot of you. I never seen anythin' like it. Sick here, sick there, whatever have you young ladies been stuffin' yourselves with?" 
"Is everybody else sick too?" I asked with some hope. 
"The whole of your lot," she affirmed with relish. "Sick as dogs and cryin' for ma." 
The room hovered around me with great gentleness, as if the chairs and the tables and the walls were withholding their weight out of sympathy for my sudden frailty. 
"The doctor's given you an injection," the nurse said from the doorway. "You'll sleep now." 
And the door took her place like a sheet of blank paper, and then a larger sheet of paper took the place of the door, and I drifted toward it and smiled myself to sleep. 
Somebody was standing by my pillow with a white cup. 
"Drink this," they said. 
I shook my head. The pillow crackled like a wad of straw. 
"Drink this and you'll feel better." 
A thick white china cup was lowered under my nose. In the wan light that might have been evening and might have been dawn I contemplated the clean amber liquid. Pads of butter floated on the surface and a faint chickeny aroma fumed up to my nostrils. 
My eyes moved tentatively to the skirt behind the cup. "Betsy," I said. 
"Betsy nothing, it's me." 
I raised my eyes then, and saw Doreen's head silhouetted against the paling window, her blonde hair lit at the tips from behind like a halo of gold. Her face was in shadow, so I couldn't make out her expression, but I felt a sort of expert tenderness flowing from the ends of her fingers. She might have been Betsy or my mother or a fern-scented nurse. 
I bent my head and took a sip of the broth. I thought my mouth must be made of sand. I took another sip and then another and another until the cup was empty. 
I felt purged and holy and ready for a new life. 
Doreen set the cup on the windowsill and lowered herself into the armchair. I noticed that she made no move to take out a cigarette, and as she was a chain smoker this surprised me. 
"Well, you almost died," she said finally. 
"I guess it was all that caviar." 
"Caviar nothing! It was the crabmeat. They did tests on it and it was chock-full of ptomaine." 
I had a vision of the celestially white kitchens of Ladies' Day stretching into infinity. I saw avocado pear after avocado pear being stuffed with crabmeat and mayonnaise and photographed under brilliant lights. I saw the delicate, pink-mottled claw meat poking seductively through its blanket of mayonnaise and the bland yellow pear cup with its rim of alligator-green cradling the whole mess. 
Poison. 
"Who did tests?" I thought the doctor might have pumped somebody's stomach and then analyzed what he found in his hotel laboratory. 
"Those dodos on Ladies' Day. As soon as you all started keeling over like ninepins somebody called into the office and the office called across to Ladies' Day and they did tests on everything left over from the big lunch. Ha!" 
"Ha!" I echoed hollowly. It was good to have Doreen back. 
"They sent presents," she added. "They're in a big carton out in the hall." 
"How did they get here so fast?" 
"Special express delivery, what do you think? They can't afford to have the lot of you running around saying you got poisoned at Ladies' Day. You could sue them for every penny they own if you just knew some smart law man." 
"What are the presents?" I began to feel if it was a good enough present I wouldn't mind about what happened, because I felt so pure as a result. 
"Nobody's opened the box yet, they're all out flat. I'm supposed to be carting soup in to everybody, seeing as I'm the only one on my feet, but I brought you yours first." 
"See what the present is," I begged. Then I remembered and said, "I've a present for you as well." 
Doreen went out into the hall. I could hear her rustling around for a minute and then the sound of paper tearing. Finally she came back carrying a thick book with a glossy cover and people's names printed all over it. 
"The Thirty Best Short Stories of the Year." She dropped the book in my lap. "There's eleven more of them out there in that box. I suppose they thought it'd give you something to read while you were sick." She paused. "Where's mine?" 
I fished in my pocketbook and handed Doreen the mirror with her name and the daisies on it. Doreen looked at me and I looked at her and we both burst out laughing. 
"You can have my soup if you want," she said. "They put twelve soups on the tray by mistake and Lenny and I stuffed down so many hotdogs while we were waiting for the rain to stop I couldn't eat another mouthful." 
"Bring it in," I said. "I'm starving." 

Five
 AT SEVEN THE NEXT MORNING the telephone rang. 
Slowly I swam up from the bottom of a black sleep. I already had a telegram from Jay Cee stuck in my mirror, telling me not to bother to come in to work but to rest for a day and get completely well, and how sorry she was about the bad crabmeat, so I couldn't imagine who would be calling. 
I reached out and hitched the receiver onto my pillow so the mouthpiece rested on my collarbone and the earpiece lay on my shoulder. 
 "Hello?" 
A man's voice said, "Is that Miss Esther Greenwood?" I thought I detected a slight foreign accent. 
"It certainly is," I said. 
"This is Constantin Something-or-Other." 
I couldn't make out the last name, but it was full of S's and K's. I didn't know any Constantin, but I hadn't the heart to say so. 
Then I remembered Mrs. Willard and her simultaneous interpreter. 
"Of course, of course!" I cried, sitting up and clutching the phone to me with both hands. 
I'd never have given Mrs. Willard credit for introducing me to a man named Constantin. 
I collected men with interesting names. I already knew a Socrates. He was tall and ugly and intellectual and the son of some big Greek movie producer in Hollywood, but also a Catholic, which ruined it for both of us. In addition to Socrates, I knew a White Russian named Attila at the Boston School of Business Administration. 
Gradually I realized that Constantin was trying to arrange a meeting for us later in the day. 
"Would you like to see the UN this afternoon?" 
"I can already see the UN," I told him, with a little hysterical giggle. 
 He seemed nonplussed. 
"I can see it from my window." I thought perhaps my English was a touch too fast for him. 
There was a silence. 
Then he said, "Maybe you would like a bite to eat afterward." 
I detected the vocabulary of Mrs. Willard and my heart sank. Mrs. Willard always invited you for a bite to eat. I remembered that this man had been a guest at Mrs. Willard's house when he first came to America -- Mrs. Willard had one of these arrangements where you open your house to foreigners and then when you go abroad they open their houses to you. 
I now saw quite clearly that Mrs. Willard had simply traded her open house in Russia for my bite to eat in New York. 
"Yes, I would like a bite to eat," I said stiffly. "What time will you come?" 
"I'll call for you in my car about two. It's the Amazon, isn't it?" 
"Yes." 
"Ah, I know where that is." 
For a moment I thought his tone was laden with special meaning, and then I figured that probably some of the girls at the Amazon were secretaries at the UN and maybe he had taken one of them out at one time. I let him hang up first, and then I hung up and lay back in the pillows, feeling grim. 
There I went again, building up a glamorous picture of a man who would love me passionately the minute he met me, and all out of a few prosy nothings. A duty tour of the UN and a post-UN sandwich! 
I tried to jack up my morale. 
Probably Mrs. Willard's simultaneous interpreter would be short and ugly and I would come to look down on him in the end the way I looked down on Buddy Willard. This thought gave me a certain satisfaction. Because I did look down on Buddy Willard, and although everybody still thought I would marry him when he came out of the TB place, I knew I would never marry him if he were the last man on earth. 
Buddy Willard was a hypocrite. 
Of course, I didn't know he was a hypocrite at first. I thought he was the most wonderful boy I'd ever seen. I'd adored him from a distance for five years before he even looked at me, and then there was a beautiful time when I still adored him and he started looking at me, and then just as he was looking at me more and more I discovered quite by accident what an awful hypocrite he was, and now he wanted me to marry him and I hated his guts. 
The worst part of it was I couldn't come straight out and tell him what I thought of him, because he caught TB before I could do that, and now I had to humor him along till he got well again and could take the unvarnished truth. 
I decided not to go down to the cafeteria for breakfast. It would only mean getting dressed, and what was the point of getting dressed if you were staying in bed for the morning? I could have called down and asked for a breakfast tray in my room, I guess, but then I would have to tip the person who brought it up and I never knew how much to tip. I'd had some very upsetting experiences trying to tip people in New York. 
When I first arrived at the Amazon a dwarfish, bald man in a bellhop's uniform carried my suitcase up in the elevator and unlocked my room for me. Of course I rushed immediately to the window and looked out to see what the view was. After a while I was aware of this bellhop turning on the hot and cold taps in the washbowl and saying "This is the hot and this is the cold" and switching on the radio and telling me all the names of all the New York stations and I began to get uneasy, so I kept my back to him and said firmly, "Thank you for bringing up my suitcase." 
"Thank you thank you thank you. Ha!" he said in a very nasty insinuating tone, and before I could wheel round to see what had come over him he was gone, shutting the door behind him with a rude slam. 
Later, when I told Doreen about his curious behavior, ske said, "You ninny, he wanted his tip." 
I asked how much I should have given and she said a quarter at least and thirty-five cents if the suitcase was too heavy. Now I could have carried that suitcase to my room perfectly well by myself, only the bellhop seemed so eager to do it that I let him. I thought that sort of service came along with what you paid for your hotel room. 
I hate handing over money to people for doing what I could just as easily do myself, it makes me nervous. 
Doreen said ten per cent was what you should tip a person, but I somehow never had the right change and I'd have felt awfully silly giving somebody half a dollar and saying, "Fifteen cents of this is a tip for you, please give me thirty-five cents back." 
The first time I took a taxi in New York I tipped the driver ten cents. The fare was a dollar, so I thought ten cents was exactly right and gave the driver my dime with a little flourish and a smile. But he only held it in the palm of his hand and stared and stared at it, and when I stepped out of the cab, hoping I had not handed him a Canadian dime by mistake, he started yelling, "Lady, I gotta live like you and everybody else," in a loud voice which scared me so much I broke into a run. Luckily he was stopped at a traffic light or I think he would have driven along beside me yelling in that embarrassing way. 
When I asked Doreen about this she said the tipping percentage might well have risen from ten to fifteen per cent since she was last in New York. Either that, or that particular cabdriver was an out-and-out louse. 
I reached for the book the people from Ladies' Day had sent. 
When I opened it a card fell out. The front of the card showed a poodle in a flowered bedjacket sitting in a poodle basket with a sad face, and the inside of the card showed the poodle lying down in the basket with a smile, sound asleep under an embroidered sampler that said, "You'll get well best with lots and lots of rest." At the bottom of the card somebody had written, "Get well quick! from all of your good friends at Ladies' Day," in lavender ink. 
I flipped through one story after another until finally I came to a story about a fig tree. 
This fig grew on a green lawn between the house of a Jewish man and a convent, and the Jewish man and a beautiful dark nun kept meeting at the tree to pick the ripe figs, until one day they saw an egg hatching in a bird's nest on a branch of the tree, and as they watched the little bird peck its way out of the egg, they touched the backs of their hands together, and then the nun didn't come out to pick figs with the Jewish man any more but a mean-faced Catholic kitchen maid came to pick them instead and counted up the figs the man picked after they were both through to be sure he hadn't picked any more than she had, and the man was furious. 
I thought it was a lovely story, especially the part about the fig tree in winter under the snow and then the fig tree in spring with all the green fruit. I felt sorry when I came to the last page. I wanted to crawl in between those black lines of print the way you crawl through a fence, and go to sleep under that beautiful big green fig tree. 
It seemed to me Buddy Willard and I were like that Jewish man and that nun, although of course we weren't Jewish or Catholic but Unitarian. We had met together under our own imaginary fig tree, and what we had seen wasn't a bird coming out of an egg but a baby coming out of a woman, and then something awful happened and we went our separate ways. 
As I lay there in my white hotel bed feeling lonely and weak, I thought I was up in that sanatorium in the Adirondacks, and I felt like a heel of the worst sort. In his letters Buddy kept telling me how he was reading poems by a poet who was also a doctor and how he'd found out about some famous dead Russian short-story writer who had been a doctor too, so maybe doctors and writers could get along fine after all 
Now this was a very different tune from what Buddy Willard had been singing all the two years we were getting to know each other. I remember the day he smiled at me and said, "Do you know what a poem is, Esther?" 
"No, what?" I said. 
"A piece of dust." And he looked so proud of having thought of this that I just stared at his blond hair and his blue eyes and his white teeth -- he had very long, strong teeth -- and said, "I guess so." 
It was only in the middle of New York a whole year later that I finally thought of an answer to that remark. 
I spent a lot of time having imaginary conversations with Buddy Willard. He was a couple of years older than I was and very scientific, so he could always prove things. When I was with him I had to work to keep my head above water. 
These conversations I had in my mind usually repeated the beginnings of conversations I'd really had with Buddy, only they finished with me answering him back quite sharply, instead of just sitting around and saying, "I guess so." 
Now, lying on my back in bed, I imagined Buddy saying, "Do you know what a poem is, Esther?" 
"No, what?" I would say. 
"A piece of dust." 
Then just as he was smiling and starting to look proud, I would say, "So are the cadavers you cut up. So are the people you think you're curing. They're dust as dust as dust. I reckon a good poem lasts a whole lot longer than a hundred of those people put together." 
And of course Buddy wouldn't have any answer to that, because what I said was true. People were made of nothing so much as dust, and I couldn't see that doctoring all that dust was a bit better than writing poems people would remember and repeat to themselves when they were unhappy or sick and couldn't sleep. 
My trouble was I took everything Buddy Willard told me as the honest-to-God truth. I remember the first night he kissed me. It was after the Yale Junior Prom. 
It was strange, the way Buddy had invited me to that prom. 
He popped into my house out of the blue one Christmas vacation, wearing a thick white turtleneck sweater and looking so handsome I could hardly stop staring, and said, "I might drop over to see you at college some day, all right?" 
I was flabbergasted. I only saw Buddy at church on Sundays when we were both home from college, and then at a distance, and I couldn't figure what had put it into his head to run over and see me -- he had run the two miles between our houses for cross-country practice, he said. 
Of course, our mothers were good friends. They had gone to school together and then both married their professors and settled down in the same town, but Buddy was always off on a scholarship at prep school in the fall or earning money by fighting blister rust in Montana in the summer, so our mothers being old school chums really didn't matter a bit. 
After this sudden visit I didn't hear a word from Buddy until one fine Saturday morning in early March. I was up in my room at college, studying about Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless for my history exam on the crusades the coming Monday, when the hall phone rang. 
Usually people are supposed to take turns answering the hall phone, but as I was the only freshman on a floor with all seniors they made me answer it most of the time. I waited a minute to see if anybody would beat me to it. Then I figured everybody was probably out playing squash or away on weekends, so I answered it myself. 
"Is that you, Esther?" the girl on watch downstairs said, and when I said yes, she said, "There's a man to see you." 
I was surprised to hear this, because of all the blind dates I'd had that year not one called me up again for a second date. I just didn't have any luck. I hated coming downstairs sweaty-handed and curious every Saturday night and having some senior introduce me to her aunt's best friend's son and finding some pale, mushroomy fellow with protruding ears or buck teeth or a bad leg. I didn't think I deserved it. After all, I wasn't crippled in any way, I just studied too hard, I didn't know when to stop. 
Well, I combed my hair and put on some more lipstick and took my history book ≠
- so I could say I was on my way to the library if it turned out to be somebody awful -- and went down, and there was Buddy Willard leaning against the mail table in a khaki zipper jacket and blue dungarees and frayed gray sneakers and grinning up at me. 
"I just came over to say hello," he said. 
I thought it odd he should come all the way up from Yale even hitchhiking, as he did, to save money, just to say hello. 
"Hello," I said. "Let's go out and sit on the porch." 
I wanted to go out on the porch because the girl on watch was a nosy senior and eyeing me curiously. She obviously thought Buddy had made a big mistake. 
We sat side by side in two wicker rocking chairs. The sunlight was clean and windless and almost hot. 
"I can't stay for more than a few minutes," Buddy said. 
"Oh, come on, stay for lunch," I said. 
"Oh, I can't do that. I'm up here for the Sophomore Prom with Joan." 
I felt like a prize idiot. 
"How is Joan?" I asked coldly. 
Joan Gilling came from our home town and went to our church and was a year 
ahead of me at college. She was a big wheel-president of her class and a physics major and the college hockey champion. She always made me feel squirmy with her starey pebble-colored eyes and her gleaming tombstone teeth and her breathy voice. She was big as a horse, too. I began to think Buddy had pretty poor taste. 
"Oh, Joan," he said. "She asked me up to this dance two months ahead of time and her mother asked my mother if I would take her, so what could I do?" 
"Well, why did you say you'd take her if you didn't want to?" I asked meanly. 
"Oh, I like Joan. She never cares whether you spend any money on her or not and she enjoys doing things out-of-doors. The last time she came down to Yale for house weekend we went on a bicycle trip to East Rock and she's the only girl I haven't had to push up hills. Joan's all right." 
I went cold with envy. I had never been to Yale, and Yale was the place all the seniors in my house liked to go best on weekends. I decided to expect nothing from Buddy Willard. If you expect nothing from somebody you are never disappointed. 
"You better go and find Joan then," I said in a matter-of-fact voice. "I've a date coming any minute and he won't like seeing me sitting around with you." 
"A date?" Buddy looked surprised. "Who is it?" 
"It's two," I said, "Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless." 
Buddy didn't say anything, so I said, "Those are their nicknames." 
Then I added, "They're from Dartmouth." 
I guess Buddy never read much history, because his mouth stiffened. He swung up from the wicker rocking chair and gave it a sharp little unnecessary push. Then he dropped a pale blue envelope with a Yale crest into my lap. 
"Here's a letter I meant to leave for you if you weren't in. There's a question in it you can answer by mail. I don't feel like asking you about it right now." 
After Buddy had gone I opened the letter. It was a letter inviting me to the Yale Junior Prom. 
I was so surprised I let out a couple of yips and ran into the house shouting, "I'm going I'm going I'm going." After the bright white sun on the porch it looked pitch dark in there, and I couldn't make out a thing. I found myself hugging the senior on watch. When she heard I was going to the Yale Junior Prom she treated me with amazement and respect. 
Oddly enough, things changed in the house after that. The seniors on my floor started speaking to me and every now and then one of them would answer the phone quite spontaneously and nobody made any more nasty loud remarks outside my door about people wasting their golden college days with their noses stuck in a book. 
Well, all during the Junior Prom Buddy treated me like a friend or a cousin. 
We danced about a mile apart the whole time, until during "Auld Lang Syne" he suddenly rested his chin on the tip of my head as if he were very tired. Then in the cold, black, three-o'clock wind we walked very slowly the five miles back to the house where I was sleeping in the living room on a couch that was too short because it only cost fifty cents a night instead of two dollars like most of the other places with proper beds. 
I felt dull and flat and full of shattered visions. 
I had imagined Buddy would fall in love with me that weekend and that I wouldn't have to worry about what I was doing on any more Saturday nights the rest of the year. Just as we approached the house where I was staying Buddy said, "Let's go up to the chemistry lab." 
I was aghast. "The chemistry lab?" 
"Yes." Buddy reached for my hand. "There's a beautiful view up there behind the chemistry lab." 
And sure enough, there was a sort of hilly place behind the chemistry lab from which you could see the lights of a couple of houses in New Haven. 
I stood pretending to admire them while Buddy got a good footing on the rough soil. While he kissed me I kept my eyes open and tried to memorize the spacing of the house lights so I would never forget them. 
Finally Buddy stepped back. "Wow!" he said. 
"Wow what?" I said, surprised. It had been a dry, uninspiring little kiss, and I remember thinking it was too bad both our mouths were so chapped from walking five miles in that cold wind. 
"Wow, it makes me feel terrific to kiss you." 
I modestly didn't say anything. 
"I guess you go out with a lot of boys," Buddy said then. 
"Well, I guess I do." I thought I must have gone out with a different boy for every week in the year. 
"Well, I have to study a lot." 
"So do I," I put in hastily. "I have to keep my scholarship after all." 
"Still, I think I could manage to see you every third weekend." 
"That's nice." I was almost fainting and dying to get back to college and tell everybody. 
Buddy kissed me again in front of the house steps, and the next fall, when his scholarship to medical school came through, I went there to see him instead of to Yale and it was there I found out how he had fooled me all those years and what a hypocrite he was. 
I found out on the day we saw the baby born. 
Six
 I had KEPT BEGGING Buddy to show me some really interesting hospital sights, so one Friday I cut all my classes and came down for a long weekend and he gave me the works. 
I started out by dressing in a white coat and sitting on a tall stool in a room with four cadavers, while Buddy and his friends cut them up. These cadavers were so unhuman-looking they didn't bother me a bit. They had stiff, leathery, purple-black skin and they smelt like old pickle jars. 
After that, Buddy took me out into the hall where they had some big glass bottles full of babies that had died before they were born. The baby in the first bottle had a large white head bent over a tiny curled-up body the size of a frog. The baby in the next bottle was bigger and the baby next to that one was bigger still and the baby in the last bottle was the size of a normal baby and he seemed to be looking at me and smiling a little piggy smile. 
I was quite proud of the calm way I stared at all these gruesome things. The only time I jumped was when I leaned my elbow on Buddy's cadaver's somach to watch him dissect a lung. After a minute or two I felt this burning sensation in my elbow and it occurred to me the cadaver might just be half alive since it was still warm, so I leapt off my stool with a small exclamation. Then Buddy explained the burning was only from the pickling fluid, and I sat back in my old position. 
In the hour before lunch Buddy took me to a lecture on sickle-cell anemia and some other depressing diseases, where they wheeled sick people out onto the platform and asked them questions and then wheeled them off and showed colored slides. 
One slide I remember showed a beautiful laughing girl with a black mole on her cheek. "Twenty days after that mole appeared the girl was dead," the doctor said, and everybody went very quiet for a minute and then the bell rang, so I never really found out what the mole was or why the girl died. 
In the afternoon we went to see a baby born. 
First we found a linen closet in the hospital corridor where Buddy took out a white mask for me to wear and some gauze. 
A tall fat medical student, big as Sydney Greenstreet, lounged nearby, watching Buddy wind the gauze round and round my head until my hair was completely covered and only my eyes peered out over the white mask. 
The medical student gave an unpleasant little snicker. "At least your mother loves you," he said. 
I was so busy thinking how very fat he was and how unfortunate it must be for a man and especially a young man to be fat, because what woman could stand leaning over that big stomach to kiss him, that I didn't immediately realize what this student had said to me was an insult. By the time I figured he must consider himself quite a fine fellow and had thought up a cutting remark about how only a mother loves a fat man, he was gone. 
Buddy was examining a queer wooden plaque on the wall with a row of holes in it, starting from a hole about the size of a silver dollar and ending with one the size of a dinner plate. 
"Fine, fine," he said to me. "There's somebody about to have a baby this minute." 
At the door of the delivery room stood a thin, stoop-shouldered medical student Buddy knew. 
"Hello, Will," Buddy said. "Who's on the job?" 
"I am," Will said gloomily, and I noticed little drops of sweat beading his high pale forehead. "I am, and it's my first." 
Buddy told me Will was a third-year man and had to deliver eight babies before he could graduate. 
Then he noticed a bustle at the far end of the hall and some men in lime-green coats and skull caps and a few nurses came moving toward us in a ragged procession wheeling a trolley with a big white lump on it. 
"You oughtn't to see this," Will muttered in my ear. "You'll never want to have a baby if you do. They oughtn't to let women watch. It'll be the end of the human race." 
Buddy and I laughed, and then Buddy shook Will's hand and we all went into the room. 
I was so struck by the sight of the table where they were lifting the woman I didn't say a word. It looked like some awful torture table, with these metal stirrups sticking up in mid-air at one end and all sorts of instruments and wires and tubes I couldn't make out properly at the other. 
Buddy and I stood together by the window, a few feet away from the woman, where we had a perfect view. 
The woman's stomach stuck up so high I couldn't see her face or the upper part of her body at all. She seemed to have nothing but an enormous spider-fat stomach and two little ugly spindly legs propped in the high stirrups, and all the time the baby was being born she never stopped making this unhuman whooing noise. 
Later Buddy told me the woman was on a drug that would make her forget she'd had any pain and that when she swore and groaned she really didn't know what she was doing because she was in a kind of twilight sleep. 
I thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent. Here was a woman in terrible pain, obviously feeling every bit of it or she wouldn't groan like that, and she would go straight home and start another baby, because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain had been, when all the time, in some secret part of her, that long, blind, doorless and windowless corridor of pain was waiting to open up and shut her in again. 
The head doctor, who was supervising Will, kept saying to the woman, "Push down, Mrs. Tomolillo, push down, that's a good girl, push down," and finally through the split, shaven place between her legs, lurid with disinfectant, I saw a dark fuzzy thing appear. 
"The baby's head," Buddy whispered under cover of the woman's groans. 
But the baby's head stuck for some reason, and the doctor told Will he'd have to make a cut. I heard the scissors close on the woman's skin like cloth and the blood began to run down -- a fierce, bright red. Then all at once the baby seemed to pop out into Will's hands, the color of a blue pluto and floured with white stuff and streaked with blood, and Will kept saying, "I'm going to drop it, I'm going to drop it, I'm going to drop it," in a terrified voice. 
"No, you're not," the doctor said, and took the baby out of Will's hands and started massaging it, and the blue color went away and the baby started to cry in a torn, croaky voice and I could see it was a boy. 
The first thing that baby did was pee in the doctor's face. I told Buddy later I didn't see how that was possible, but he said it was quite possible, though unusual, to see something like that happen. 
As soon as the baby was born the people in the room divided up into two groups, the nurses tying a metal dog tag on the baby's wrist and swabbing its eyes with cotton on the end of a stick and wrapping it up and putting it in a canvas-sided cot, while the doctor and Will started sewing up the woman's cut with a needle and a long thread. 
I think somebody said, "It's a boy, Mrs. Tomolillo," but the woman didn't answer or raise her head. 
"Well, how was it?" Buddy asked with a satisfied expression as we walked across the green quadrangle to his room. 
"Wonderful," I said. "I could see something like that every day." 
I didn't feel up to asking him if there were any other ways to have babies. For some reason the most important thing to me was actually seeing the baby come out of you yourself and making sure it was yours. I thought if you had to have all that pain anyway you might just as well stay awake. 
I had always imagined myself hitching up on to my elbows on the delivery table after it was all over -- dead white, of course, with no makeup and from the awful ordeal, but smiling and radiant, with my hair down to my waist, and reaching out for my first little squirmy child and saying its name, whatever it was. 
"Why was it all covered with flour?" I asked then, to keep the conversation going, and Buddy told me about the waxy staff that guarded the baby's skin. 
When we were back in Buddy's room, which reminded me of nothing so much as a monk's cell, with its bare walls and bare bed and bare floor and the desk loaded with Gray's Anatomy and other thick gruesome books, Buddy lit a candle and uncorked a bottle of Dubonnet. Then we lay down side by side on the bed and Buddy sipped his wine while I read aloud "somewhere I have never travelled" and other poems from a book I'd brought. 
Buddy said he figured there must be something in poetry if a girl like me spent all her days over it, so each time we met I read him some poetry and explained to him what I found in it. It was Buddy's idea. He always arranged our weekends so we'd never regret wasting our time in any way. Buddy's father was a teacher, and I think Buddy could have been a teacher as well, he was always trying to explain things to me and introduce me to new knowledge. 
Suddenly, after I finished a poem, he said, "Esther, have you ever seen a man?" 
The way he said it I knew he didn't mean a regular man or a man in general, I knew he meant a man naked. 
"No," I said. "Only statues." 
"Well, don't you think you would like to see me?" 
I didn't know what to say. My mother and my grandmother had started hinting around to me a lot lately about what a fine, clean boy Buddy Willard was, coming from such a fine, clean family, and how everybody at church thought he was a model person, so kind to his parents and to older people, as well as so athletic and so handsome and so intelligent. 
All I'd heard about, really, was how fine and clean Buddy was and how he was the kind of a person a girl should stay fine and clean for. So I didn't really see the harm in anything Buddy would think up to do. 
"Well, all right, I guess so," I said. 
I stared at Buddy while he unzipped his chino pants and took them off and laid them on a chair and then took off his underpants that were made of something like nylon fishnet. 
"They're cool," he explained, "and my mother says they wash easily." 
Then he just stood there in front of me and I kept staring at him. The only thing I could think of was turkey neck and turkey gizzards and I felt very depressed. 
Buddy seemed hurt I didn't say anything. "I think you ought to get used to me like this," he said. "Now let me see you." 
But undressing in front of Buddy suddenly appealed to me about as much as having my Posture Picture taken at college, where you have to stand naked in front of a camera, knowing all the time that a picture of you stark naked, both full view and side view, is going into the college gym files to be marked A B C or D depending on how straight you are. 
"Oh, some other time," I said. 
"All right." Buddy got dressed again. 
Then we kissed and hugged a while and I felt a little better. I drank the rest of the Dubonnet and sat cross-legged at the end of Buddy's bed and asked for a comb. I began to comb my hair down over my face so Buddy couldn't see it. Suddenly I said, "Have you ever had an affair with anyone, Buddy?" 
I don't know what made me say it, the words just popped out of my mouth. I never thought for one minute that Buddy Willard would have an affair with anyone. I expected him to say, "No, I have been saving myself for when I get married to somebody pure and a virgin like you." 
But Buddy didn't say anything, he just turned pink. 
"Well, have you?" 
"What do you mean, an affair?" Buddy asked then in a hollow voice. 
"You know, have you ever gone to bed with anyone?" I kept rhythmically combing the hair down over the side of my face nearest to Buddy, and I could feel the little electric filaments clinging to my hot cheeks and I wanted to shout, "Stop, stop, don't tell me, don't say anything." But I didn't, I just kept still. 
"Well, yes, I have," Buddy said finally. 
I almost fell over. From the first night Buddy Willard kissed me and said I must go out with a lot of boys, he made me feel I was much more sexy and experienced than he was and that everything he did like hugging and kissing and petting was simply what I made him feel like doing out of the blue, he couldn't help it and didn't know how it came about. 
Now I saw he had only been pretending all this time to be so innocent. 
"Tell me about it." I combed my hair slowly over and over, feeling the teeth of the comb dig into my cheek at every stroke. "Who was it?" 
Buddy seemed relieved I wasn't angry. He even seemed relieved to have somebody to tell about how he was seduced. 
Of course, somebody had seduced Buddy, Buddy hadn't started it and it wasn't really his fault. It was this waitress at the hotel he worked at as a busboy the last summer at Cape Cod. Buddy had noticed her staring at him queerly and shoving her breasts up against him in the confusion of the kitchen, so finally one day he asked her what the trouble was and she looked him straight in the eye and said, "I want you." 
"Served up with parsley?" Buddy had laughed innocently. 
"No," she had said. "Some night." 
And that's how Buddy had lost his pureness and his virginity. 
At first I thought he must have slept with the waitress only the once, but when I asked how many times, just to make sure, he said he couldn't remember but a couple of times a week for the rest of the summer. I multiplied three by ten and got thirty, which seemed beyond all reason. 
After that something in me just froze up. 
Back at college I started asking a senior here and a senior there what they would do if a boy they knew suddenly told them he'd slept thirty times with some slutty waitress one summer, smack in the middle of knowing them. But these seniors said most boys were like that and you couldn't honestly accuse them of anything until you were at least pinned or engaged to be married. 
Actually, it wasn't the idea of Buddy sleeping with somebody that bothered me. I mean I'd read about all sorts of people sleeping with each other, and if it had been any other boy I would merely have asked him the most interesting details, and maybe gone out and slept with somebody myself just to even things up, and then thought no more about it. 
What I couldn't stand was Buddy's pretending I was so sexy and he was so pure, when all the time he'd been having an affair with that tarty waitress and must have felt like laughing in my face. 
"What does your mother think about this waitress?" I asked Buddy that weekend. 
Buddy was amazingly close to his mother. He was always quoting what she said about the relationship between a man and a woman, and I knew Mrs. Willard was a real fanatic about virginity for men and women both. When I first went to her house for supper she gave me a queer, shrewd, searching look, and I knew she was trying to tell whether I was a virgin or not. 
Just as I thought, Buddy was embarrassed. "Mother asked me about Gladys," he admitted.  
"Well, what did you say?"  
"I said Gladys was free, white and twenty-one." 
Now I knew Buddy would never talk to his mother as rudely as that for my sake. He was always saying how his mother said, "What a man wants is a mate and what a woman wants is infinite security," and, "What a man is is an arrow into the future and what a woman is is the place the arrow shoots off from," until it made me tired. 
Every time I tried to argue, Buddy would say his mother still got pleasure out of his father and wasn't that wonderful for people their age, it must mean she really knew what was what. 
Well, I had just decided to ditch Buddy Willard for once and for all, not because he'd slept with that waitress but because he didn't have the honest guts to admit it straight off to everybody and face up to it as part of his character, when the phone in the hall rang and somebody said in a little knowing singsong, "It's for you, Esther, it's from Boston." 
I could tell right away something must be wrong, because Buddy was the only person I knew in Boston, and he never called me long distance because it was so much more expensive than letters. Once, when he had a message he wanted me to get almost immediately, he went all round his entry at medical school asking if anybody was driving up to my college that weekend, and sure enough, somebody was, so he gave them a note for me and I got it the same day. He didn't even have to pay for a stamp. 
It was Buddy all right. He told me that the annual fall chest X-ray showed he had caught TB and he was going off on a scholarship for medical students who caught TB to a TB place in the Adirondacks. Then he said I hadn't written since that last weekend and he hoped nothing was the matter between us, and would I please try to write him at least once a week and come to visit him at this TB place in my Christmas vacation? 
I had never heard Buddy so upset. He was very proud of his perfect health and was always telling me it was psychosomatic when my sinuses blocked up and I couldn't breathe. I thought this an odd attitude for a doctor to have and perhaps he should study to be a psychiatrist instead, but of course I never came right out and said so. 
I told Buddy how sorry I was about the TB and promised to write, but when I hung up I didn't feel one bit sorry. I only felt a wonderful relief. 
I thought the TB might just be a punishment for living the kind of double life Buddy lived and feeling so superior to people. And I thought how convenient it would be now I didn't have to announce to everybody at college I had broken off with Buddy and start the boring business of blind dates all over again. 
I simply told everyone that Buddy had TB and we were practically engaged, and when I stayed in to study on Saturday nights they were extremely kind to me because they thought I was so brave, working the way I did just to hide a broken heart 

Seven
 OF COURSE, Constantin was much too short, but in his own way he was handsome, with light brown hair and dark blue eyes and a lively, challenging expression. He could almost have been an American, he was so tan and had such good teeth, but I could tell straight away that he wasn't. He had what no American man I've ever met has had, and that's intuition. 
From the start Constantin guessed I wasn't any protÈgÈ of Mrs. Willard's. I raised an eyebrow here and dropped a dry little laugh there, and pretty soon we were both openly raking Mrs. Willard over the coals and I thought, "This Constantin won't mind if I'm too tall and don't know enough languages and haven't been to Europe, he'll see through all that stuff to what I really am." 
Constantin drove me to the UN in his old green convertible with cracked, comfortable brown leather seats and the top down. He told me his tan came from playing tennis, and when we were sitting there side by side flying down the streets in the open sun he took my hand and squeezed it, and I felt happier than I had been since I was about nine and running along the hot white beaches with my father the summer before he died. 
And while Constantin and I sat in one of those hushed plush auditoriums in the UN, next to a stern muscular Russian girl with no makeup who was a simultaneous interpreter like Constantin, I thought how strange it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I was nine years old. 
After that -- in spite of the Girl Scouts and the piano lessons and the water-color lessons and the dancing lessons and the sailing camp, all of which my mother scrimped to give me, and college, with crewing in the mist before breakfast and blackbottom pies and the little new firecrackers of ideas going off every day -- I had never been really happy again. 
I stared through the Russian girl in her double-breasted gray suit, rattling off idiom after idiom in her own unknowable tongue -- which Constantin said was the most difficult part because the Russians didn't have the same idioms as our idioms -- and I wished with all my heart I could crawl into her and spend the rest of my life barking out one idiom after another. It mightn't make me any happier, but it would be one more little pebble of efficiency among all the other pebbles. 
Then Constantin and the Russian girl interpreter and the whole bunch of black and white and yellow men arguing down there behind their labeled microphones seemed to move off at a distance. I saw their mouths going up and down without a sound, as if they were sitting on the deck of a departing ship, stranding me in the middle of a huge 
silence. 
I started adding up all the things I couldn't do. 
I began with cooking. 
My grandmother and my mother were such good cooks that I left everything to them. They were always trying to teach me one dish or another, but I would just look on and say, "Yes, yes, I see," while the instructions slid through my head like water, and then I'd always spoil what I did so nobody would ask me to do it again. 
I remember Jody, my best and only girlfriend at college in my freshman year, making me scrambled eggs at her house one morning. They tasted unusual, and when I asked her if she had put in anything extra, she said cheese and garlic salt. I asked who told her to do that, and she said nobody, she just thought it up. But then, she was practical and a sociology major. 
I didn't know shorthand either. 
This meant I couldn't get a good job after college. My mother kept telling me nobody wanted a plain English major. But an English major who knew shorthand was something else again. Everybody would want her. She would be in demand among all the up-and-coming young men and she would transcribe letter after thrilling letter. 
The trouble was, I hated the idea of serving men in any way. I wanted to dictate my own thrilling letters. Besides, those little shorthand symbols in the book my mother showed me seemed just as bad as let t equal time and let s equal the total distance. 
My list grew longer. 
I was a terrible dancer. I couldn't carry a tune. I had no sense of balance, and when we had to walk down a narrow board with our hands out and a book on our heads in gym class I always fell over. I couldn't ride a horse or ski, the two things I wanted to do most, because they cost too much money. I couldn't speak German or read Hebrew or write Chinese. I didn't even know where most of the old out-of-the-way countries the UN men in front of me represented fitted in on the map. 
For the first time in my life, sitting there in the soundproof heart of the UN building between Constantin who could play tennis as well as simultaneouly interpret and the Russian girl who knew so many idioms, I felt dreadfully inadequate. The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn't thought about it. 
The one thing I was good at was winning scholarships and prizes, and that era was coming to an end. 
I felt like a racehorse in a world without racetracks or a champion college footballer suddenly confronted by Wall Street and a business suit, his days of glory shrunk to a little gold cup on his mantel with a date engraved on it like the date on a tombstone. 
I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. 
From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. 
I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet. 
Constantin's restaurant smelt of herbs and spices and sour cream. All the time I had been in New York I had never found such a restaurant. I only found those Heavenly Hamburger places, where they serve giant hamburgers and soup-of-the-day and four kinds of fancy cake at a very clean counter facing a long glarey mirror. 
To reach this restaurant we had to climb down seven dimly lit steps into a sort of cellar. 
Travel posters plastered the smoke-dark walls, like so many picture windows overlooking Swiss lakes and Japanese mountains and African velds, and thick, dusty bottle-candles, that seemed for centuries to have wept their colored waxes red over blue over green in a fine, three-dimensional lace, cast a circle of light round each table where the faces floated, flushed and flamelike themselves. 
I don't know what I ate, but I felt immensely better after the first mouthful. It occurred to me that my vision of the fig tree and all the fat figs that withered and fell to earth might well have arisen from the profound void of an empty stomach. 
Constantin kept refilling our glasses with a sweet Greek wine that tasted of pine bark, and I found myself telling him how I was going to learn German and go to Europe and be a war correspondent like Maggie Higgins. 
I felt so fine by the time we came to the yogurt and strawberry jam that I decided I would let Constantin seduce me. 
Ever since Buddy Willard had told me about that waitress I had been thinking I ought to go out and sleep with somebody myself. Sleeping with Buddy wouldn't count, though, because he would still be one person ahead of me, it would have to be with somebody else. 
The only boy I ever actually discussed going to bed with was a bitter, hawk-nosed Southerner from Yale, who came to college one weekend only to find his date had eloped with a taxi driver the day before. As the girl had lived in my house and I was the only one home that particular night, it was my job to cheer him up. 
At the local coffee shop, hunched in one of the secretive, high-backed booths with hundreds of people's names gouged into the wood, we drank cup after cup of black coffee and talked frankly about sex. 
This boy -- his name was Eric -- said he thought it disgusting the way all the girls at my college stood around on the porches under the lights and in the bushes in plain view, necking madly before the one o'clock curfew, so everybody passing by could see them. A million years of evolution, Eric said bitterly, and what are we? Animals. 
Then Eric told me how he had slept with his first woman. 
He went to a Southern prep school that specialized in building all-round gentlemen, and by the time you graduated it was an unwritten rule that you had to have known a woman. Known in the Biblical sense, Eric said. 
So one Saturday Eric and a few of his classmates took a bus into the nearest city and visited a notorious whorehouse. Eric's whore hadn't even taken off her dress. She was a fat, middle-aged woman with dyed red hair and suspiciously thick lips and rat-colored skin and she wouldn't turn off the light, so he had had her under a fly-spotted twenty-five≠watt bulb, and it was nothing like it was cracked up to be. It was boring as going to the toilet, 
I said maybe if you loved a woman it wouldn't seem so boring, but Eric said it would be spoiled by thinking this woman too was just an animal like the rest, so if he loved anybody he would never go to bed with her. He'd go to a whore if he had to and keep the woman he loved free of all that dirty business. 
It had crossed my mind at the time that Eric might be a good person to go to bed with, since he had already done it and, unlike the usual run of boys, didn't seem dirty-minded or silly when he talked about it. But then Eric wrote me a letter saying he thought he might really be able to love me, I was so intelligent and cynical and yet had such a kind face, surprisingly like his older sister's; so I knew it was no use, I was the type he would never go to bed with, and wrote him I was unfortunately about to marry a childhood sweetheart. 
The more I thought about it the better I liked the idea of being seduced by a simultaneous interpreter in New York City. Constantin seemed mature and considerate in every way. There were no people I knew he would want to brag to about it, the way college boys bragged about sleeping with girls in the backs of cars to their roommates or their friends on the basketball team. And there would be a pleasant irony in sleeping with a man Mrs. Willard had introduced me to, as if she were, in a roundabout way, to blame for it. 
When Constantin asked if I would like to come up to his apartment to hear some balalaika records I smiled to myself. My mother had always told me never under any circumstances to go with a man to a man's rooms after an evening out, it could mean only one thing. 
"I am very fond of balalaika music," I said. 
Constantin's room had a balcony, and the balcony overlooked the river, and we could hear the hooing of the tugs down in the darkness. I felt moved and tender and perfectly certain about what I was going to do. 
I knew I might have a baby, but that thought hung far and dim in the distance and didn't trouble me at all. There was no one hundred per cent sure way not to have a baby, it said in an article my mother cut out of the Reader's Digest and mailed to me at college. This article was written by a married woman lawyer with children and called "In Defense of Chastity." 
It gave all the reasons a girl shouldn't sleep with anybody but her husband and then only after they were married. 
The main point of the article was that a man's world is different from a woman's world and a man's emotions are different from a woman's emotions and only marriage can bring the two worlds and the two different sets of emotions together properly. My mother said this was something a girl didn't know about till it was too late, so she had to take the advice of people who were already experts, like a married woman. 
This woman lawyer said the best men wanted to be pure for their wives, and even if they weren't pure, they wanted to be the ones to teach their wives about sex. Of course they would try to persuade a girl to have sex and say they would marry her later, but as soon as she gave in, they would lose all respect for her and start saying that if she did that with them she would do that with other men and they would end up by making her life miserable. 
The woman finished her article by saying better be safe than sorry and besides, there was no sure way of not getting stuck with a baby and then you'd really be in a pickle. 
Now the one thing this article didn't seem to me to consider was how a girl felt. 
It might be nice to be pure and then to marry a pure man, but what if he suddenly confessed he wasn't pure after we were married, the way Buddy Willard had? I couldn't stand the idea of a woman having to have a single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure and one not. 
Finally I decided that if it was so difficult to find a red-blooded intelligent man who was still pure by the time he was twenty-one I might as well forget about staying pure myself and marry somebody who wasn't pure either. Then when he started to make my life miserable I could make his miserable as well. 
When I was nineteen, pureness was the great issue. 
Instead of the world being divided up into Catholics and Protestants or Republicans and Democrats or white men and black men or even men and women, I saw the world divided into people who had slept with somebody and people who hadn't, and this seemed the only really significant difference between one person and another. 
I thought a spectacular change would come over me the day I crossed the boundary line. 
I thought it would be the way I'd feel if I ever visited Europe. I'd come home, and if I looked closely into the mirror I'd be able to make out a little white Alp at the back of my eye. Now I thought that if I looked into the mirror tomorrow I'd see a doll-size Constantin sitting in my eye and smiling out at me. 
Well, for about an hour we lounged on Constantin's balcony in two separate slingback chairs with the victrola playing and the balalaika records stacked between us. A faint milky light diffused from the street lights or the half moon or the cars or the stars, I couldn't tell what, but apart from holding my hand Constantin showed no desire to seduce me whatsoever. 
I asked if he was engaged or had any special girlfriend, thinking maybe that's what was the matter, but he said no, he made a point of keeping clear of such attachments. 
At last I felt a powerful drowsiness drifting through my veins from all the pine-bark wine I had drunk. 
"I think I'll go in and lie down," I said. 
I strolled casually into the bedroom and stooped over to nudge off my shoes. The clean bed bobbed before me like a safe boat. I stretched full length and shut my eyes. Then I heard Constantin sigh and come in from the balcony. One by one his shoes clonked on to the floor, and he lay down by my side. 
I looked at him secretly from under a fall of hair. 
He was lying on his back, his hands under his head, staring at the ceiling. The starched white sleeves of his shirt, rolled up to the elbows, glimmered eerily in the half dark and his tan skin seemed almost black. I thought be must be the most beautiful man I'd ever seen. 
I thought if only I had a keen, shapely bone structure to my face or could discuss politics shrewdly or was a famous writer Constantin might find me interesting enough to sleep with. 
And then I wondered if as soon as he came to like me he would sink into ordinariness, and if as soon as he came to love me I would find fault after fault, the way I did with Buddy Willard and the boys before him. 
The same thing happened over and over: 
I would catch sight of some flawless man off in the distance, but as soon as he moved closer I immediately saw he wouldn't do at all. 
That's one of the reasons I never wanted to get married. The last thing I wanted was infinite security and to be the place an arrow shoots off from. I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket. 
I woke to the sound of rain. 
It was pitch dark. After a while I deciphered the faint outlines of an unfamiliar window. Every so often a beam of light appeared out of thin air, traversed the wall like a ghostly, exploratory finger, and slid off into nothing again. 
Then I heard the sound of somebody breathing. 
At first I thought it was only myself, and that I was lying in the dark in my hotel room after being poisoned. I held my breath, but the breathing kept on. 
A green eye glowed on the bed beside me. It was divided into quarters like a compass. I reached out slowly and dosed my hand on it. I lifted it up. With it came an arm, heavy as a dead man's, but warm with sleep. 
Constantin's watch said three o'clock. 
He was lying in his shirt and trousers and stocking feet just as I had left him when I dropped asleep, and as my eyes grew used to the darkness I made out his pale eyelids and his straight nose and his tolerant, shapely mouth, but they seemed insubstantial, as if drawn on fog. For a few minutes I leaned over, studying him. I had never fallen asleep beside a man before. 
I tried to imagine what it would be like if Constantin were my husband. 
It would mean getting up at seven and cooking him eggs and bacon and toast and coffee and dawdling about in my nightgown and curlers after he'd left for work to wash up the dirty plates and make the bed, and then when he came home after a lively, fascinating day he'd expect a big dinner, and I'd spend the evening washing up even more dirty plates till I fell into bed, utterly exhausted. 
This seemed a dreary and wasted life for a girl with fifteen years of straight A's, but I knew that's what marriage was like, because cook and clean and wash was just what Buddy Willard's mother did from morning till night, and she was the wife of a university professor and had been a private school teacher herself. 
Once when I visited Buddy I found Mrs. Willard braiding a rug out of strips of wool from Mr. Willard's old suits. She'd spent weeks on that rug, and I had admired the tweedy browns and greens and blues patterning the braid, but after Mrs. Willard was through, instead of hanging the rug on the wall the way I would have done, she put it down in place of her kitchen mat, and in a few days it was soiled and dull and indistinguishable from any mat you could buy for under a dollar in the five and ten. 
And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard's kitchen mat 
Hadn't my own mother told me that as soon as she and my father left Reno on their honeymoon -- my father had been married before, so he needed a divorce -- my father said to her, "Whew, that's a relief, now we can stop pretending and be ourselves"? ≠
- and from that day on my mother never had a minute's peace. 
I also remembered Buddy Willard saying in a sinister, knowing way that after I had children I would feel differently, I wouldn't want to write poems any more. So I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterward you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state. 
As I stared down at Constantin the way you stare down at a bright, unattainable pebble at the bottom of a deep well, his eyelids lifted and he looked through me, and his eyes were full of love. I watched dumbly as a shutter of recognition clicked across the blur of tenderness and the wide pupils went glossy and depthless as patent leather. 
Constantin sat up, yawning. "What time is it?" 
"Three," I said in a flat voice. "I better go home. I have to be at work first thing in the morning." 
"I'll drive you." 
As we sat back to back on our separate sides of the bed fumbling with our shoes in the horrid cheerful white light of the bed lamp, I sensed Constantin turn round. "Is your hair always like that?"
 "Like what?" 
He didn't answer but reached over and put his hand at the root of my hair and ran his fingers out slowly to the tip ends like a comb. A little electric shock flared through me and I sat quite still. Ever since I was small I loved feeling somebody comb my hair. It made me go all sleepy and peaceful. 
"Ah, I know what it is," Constantin said. "You've just washed it." 
And he bent to lace up his tennis shoes. 
An hour later I lay in my hotel bed, listening to the rain. It didn't even sound like rain, it sounded like a tap running. The ache in the middle of my left shin bone came to life, and I abandoned any hope of sleep before seven, when my radio-alarm clock would rouse me with its hearty renderings of Sousa. 
Every time it rained the old leg-break seemed to remember itself, and what it remembered was a dull hurt. 
Then I thought, "Buddy Willard made me break that leg." 
Then I thought, "No, I broke it myself. I broke it on purpose to pay myself back 
for being such a heel." 

Eight 
 MR. WILLARD drove me up to the Adirondacks. 
It was the day after Christmas and a gray sky bellied over us, fat with snow. I felt overstuffed and dull and disappointed, the way I always do the day after Christmas, as if whatever it was the pine boughs and the candles and the silver and gilt-ribboned presents and the birch-log fires and the Christmas turkey and the carols and the piano promised never came to pass. 
At Christmas I almost wished I was a Catholic. 
First Mr. Willard drove and then I drove. I don't know what we talked about, but as the countryside, already deep under old falls of snow, turned us a bleaker shoulder, and as the fir trees crowded down from the gray hills to the road edge, so darkly green they looked black, I grew gloomier and gloomier. 
I was tempted to tell Mr. Willard to go ahead alone, I would hitchhike home. 
But one glance at Mr. Willard's face -- the silver hair in its boyish crewcut, the clear blue eyes, the pink cheeks, all frosted like a sweet wedding cake with the innocent, trusting expression -- and I knew I couldn't do it. I'd have to see the visit through to the end. 
At midday the grayness paled a bit, and we parked in an icy turnoff and shared out the tunafish sandwiches and the oatmeal cookies and the apples and the thermos of black coffee Mrs. Willard had packed for our lunch. 
Mr. Willard eyed me kindly. Then he cleared his throat and brushed a few last crumbs from his lap. I could tell he was going to say something serious, because he was very shy, and I'd heard him dear his throat in that same way before giving an important economics lecture. 
"Nelly and I have always wanted a daughter." 
For one crazy minute I thought, Mr. Willard was going to announce that Mrs. Willard was pregnant and expecting a baby girl. Then he said, "But I don't see how any daughter could be nicer than you." 
Mr. Willard must have thought I was crying because I was so glad he wanted to be a father to me. "There, there," he patted my shoulder and cleared his throat once or twice. "I think we understand each other." 
Then he opened the car door on his side and strolled round to my side, his breath shaping tortuous smoke signals in the gray air. I moved over to the seat he had left and he started the car and we drove on. 
I'm not sure what I expected of Buddy's sanatorium. 
I think I expected a kind of wooden chalet perched up on top of a small mountain, with rosy-cheeked young men and women, all very attractive but with hectic glittering eyes, lying covered with thick blankets on outdoor balconies. 
"TB is like living with a bomb in your lung," Buddy had written to me at college. "You just lie around very quietly hoping it won't go off." 
I found it hard to imagine Buddy lying quietly. His whole philosophy of life was to be up and doing every second. Even when we went to the beach in the summer he never lay down to drowse in the sun the way I did. He ran back and forth or played ball or did a little series of rapid pushups to use the time. 
Mr. Willard and I waited in the reception room for the end of the afternoon rest cure. 
The color scheme of the whole sanatorium seemed to be based on liver. Dark, glowering woodwork, burnt-brown leather chairs, walls that might once have been white but had succumbed under a spreading malady of mold or damp. A mottled brown linoleum sealed off the floor. 
On a low coffee table, with circular and semicircular stains bitten into the dark veneer, lay a few wilted numbers of Time and Life. I flipped to the middle of the nearest magazine. The face of Eisenhower beamed up at me, bald and blank as the face of a fetus in a bottle. 
After a while I became aware of a sly, leaking noise. For a minute I thought the walls had begun to discharge the moisture that must saturate them, but then I saw the noise came from a small fountain in one corner of the room. 
The fountain spurted a few inches into the air from a rough length of pipe, threw up its hands, collapsed and drowned its ragged dribble in a stone basin of yellowing water. The basin was paved with the white hexagonal tiles one finds in public lavatories. 
A buzzer sounded. Doors opened and shut in the distance. Then Buddy came in. 
 "Hello, Dad." 
Buddy hugged his father, and promptly, with a dreadful brightness, came over to me and held out his hand. I shook it. It felt moist and fat. 
Mr. Willard and I sat together on a leather couch. Buddy perched opposite us on the edge of a slippery armchair. He kept smiling, as if the corners of his mouth were strung up on invisible wire. 
The last thing I expected was for Buddy to be fat. All the time I thought of him at the sanatorium I saw shadows carving themselves under his cheekbones and his eyes burning out of almost fleshless sockets. 
But everything concave about Buddy had suddenly turned convex. A pot belly swelled under the tight white nylon shirt and his cheeks were round and ruddy as marzipan fruit. Even his laugh sounded plump. 
Buddy's eyes met mine. "It's the eating," he said. "They stuff us day after day and then just make us lie around. But I'm allowed out on walk hours now, so don't worry, I'll thin down in a couple of weeks." He jumped up, smiling like a glad host. "Would you like to see my room?" 
I followed Buddy, and Mr. Willard followed me, through a pair of swinging doors set with panes of frosted glass down a dim, liver-colored corridor smelling of floor wax and Lysol and another vaguer odor, like bruised gardenias. 
Buddy threw open a brown door, and we filed into the narrow room. 
A lumpy bed, shrouded by a thin white spread, pencil-striped with blue, took up most of the space. Next to it stood a bed table with a pitcher and a water glass and the silver twig of a thermometer poking up from a jar of pink disinfectant. A second table, covered with books and papers and off-kilter clay pots -- baked and painted, but not glazed -- squeezed itself between the bed foot and the closet door. 
"Well," Mr. Willard breathed, "it looks comfortable enough." 
 Buddy laughed. 
"What are these?" I picked up a clay ashtray in the shape of a lilypad, with the veinings carefully drawn in yellow on a murky green ground. Buddy didn't smoke.  
"That's an ashtray," Buddy said. "It's for you."  
I put the tray down. "I don't smoke." 
"I know," Buddy said. "I thought you might like it, though." 
"Well," Mr. Willard rubbed one papery lip against another. "I guess I'll be getting on. I guess I'll be leaving you two young people. . ." 
"Fine, Dad. You be getting on." 
I was surprised. I had thought Mr. Willard was going to stay the night before driving me back the next day. "Shall I come too?" 
"No, no." Mr. Willard peeled a few bills from his wallet and handed them to Buddy. "See that Esther gets a comfortable seat on the train. She'll stay a day or so, maybe." Buddy escorted his father to the door. 
I felt Mr. Willard had deserted me. I thought he must have planned it all along, but Buddy said no, his father simply couldn't stand the sight of sickness and especially his own son's sickness, because he thought all sickness was sickness of the will. Mr. Willard had never been sick a day in his life. 
I sat down on Buddy's bed. There simply wasn't anywhere else to sit. 
Buddy rummaged among his papers in a businesslike way. Then he handed me a thin, gray magazine. "Turn to page eleven." 
The magazine was printed somewhere in Maine and full of stenciled poems and descriptive paragraphs separated from each other by asterisks. On page eleven I found a poem titled "Florida Dawn." I skipped down through image after image about watermelon lights and turtle-green palms and shells fluted like bits of Greek architecture. 
"Not bad." I thought it was dreadful. 
"Who wrote it?" Buddy asked with an odd, pigeony smile. 
My eye dropped to the name on the lower right-hand corner of the page. B. S. Willard. 
"I don't know." Then I said, "Of course I know, Buddy. You wrote it." 
Buddy edged over to me. 
I edged back. I have very little knowledge about TB, but it seemed to me an extremely sinister disease, the way it went on so invisibly. I thought Buddy might well be sitting in his own little murderous aura of TB germs. 
"Don't worry," Buddy kughed. "I'm not positive." 
 "Positive?" 
"You can't catch anything." 
Buddy stopped for a breath, the way you do in the middle of climbing something very steep. 
"I want to ask you a question." He had a disquieting new habit of boring into my eyes with his look as if actually bent on piercing my head, the better to analyze what went on inside it. 
"I'd thought of asking it by letter." 
I had a fleeting vision of a pale blue envelope with a Yale crest on the back flap. 
"But then I decided it would be better if I waited until you came up, so I could ask you in person." He paused. "Well, don't you want to know what it is?" 
"What?" I said in a small, unpromising voice. 
Buddy sat down beside me. He put his arm around my waist and brushed the hair from my ear. I didn't move. Then I heard him whisper, "How would you like to be Mrs. Buddy Willard?" 
I had an awful impulse to laugh. 
I thought how that question would have bowled me over at any time in my five- or six-year period of adoring Buddy Willard from a distance. 
Buddy saw me hesitate. 
"Oh, I'm in no shape now, I know," he said quickly. "I'm still on P.A.S. and I may yet lose a rib or two, but I'll be back at med school by next fall. A year from this spring at the latest. . ." 
"I think I should tell you something, Buddy." 
"I know," Buddy said stiffly. "You've met someone." 
"No, it's not that." 
"What is it, then?" 
"I'm never going to get married." 
"You're crazy." Buddy brightened. "You'll change your mind." 
"No. My mind's made up." 
But Buddy just went on looking cheerful. 
"Remember," I said, "that time you hitchhiked back to college with me after Skit Night?"
 "I remember." 
"Remember how you asked me where would I like to live best, the country or the city?" 
"And you said. . ." 
"And I said I wanted to live in the country and in the city both?" 
 Buddy nodded. 
"And you," I continued with sudden force, "laughed and said I had the perfect setup of a true neurotic and that that question came from some questionnaire you'd had in psychology class that week?" 
Buddy's smile dimmed. 
"Well, you were right. I am neurotic. I could never settle down in either the country or the city." 
"You could live between them," Buddy suggested helpfully. "Then you could go to the city sometimes and to the country sometimes." 
"Well, what's so neurotic about that?" 
Buddy didn't answer. 
"Well?" I rapped out, thinking, You can't coddle these sick people, it's the worst thing for them, it'll spoil them to bits. 
"Nothing," Buddy said in a pale, still voice. 
"Neurotic, ha!" I let out a scornful laugh. "If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I'm neurotic as hell. I'll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days." 
Buddy put his hand on mine.  
"Let me fly with you." 
I stood at the top of the ski slope on Mount Pisgah, looking down. I had no business to be up there. I had never skied before in my life. Still, I thought I would enjoy the view while I had the chance. 
At my left, the rope tow deposited skier after skier on the snowy summit which, packed by much crossing and recrossing and slightly melted in the noon sun, had hardened to the consistency and polish of glass. The cold air punished my lungs and sinuses to a visionary clearness. 
On every side of me the red and blue and white jacketed skiers tore away down the blinding slope like fugitive bits of an American flag. From the foot of the ski run, the imitation log cabin lodge piped its popular songs into the overhang of silence. 
Gazing down on the Jungfrau 
From our chalet for two. . . 
The lilt and boom threaded by me like an invisible rivulet in a desert of snow. One careless, superb gesture, and I would be hurled into motion down the slope toward the small khaki spot in the sidelines, among the spectators, which was Buddy Willard. 
All morning Buddy had been teaching me how to ski. 
First, Buddy borrowed skis and ski poles from a friend of his in the village, and ski boots from a doctor's wife whose feet were only one size larger than my own, and a red ski jacket from a student nurse. His persistence in the face of mulishness was astounding. 
Then I remembered that at medical school Buddy had won a prize for persuading the most relatives of dead people to have their dead ones cut up whether they needed it or not, in the interests of science. I forget what the prize was, but I could just see Buddy in his white coat with his stethoscope sticking out of a side pocket like part of his anatomy, smiling and bowing and talking those numb, dumb relatives into signing the postmortem papers. 
Next, Buddy borrowed a car from his own doctor, who'd had TB himself and was very understanding, and we drove off as the buzzer for walk hour rasped along the sunless sanatorium corridors. 
Buddy had never skied before either, but he said that the elementary principles were quite simple, and as he'd often watched the ski instructors and their pupils he could teach me all I'd need to know. 
For the first half hour I obediently herringboned up a small slope, pushed off with my poles and coasted straight down. Buddy seemed pleased with my progress. 
"That's fine, Esther," he observed, as I negotiated my slope for the twentieth time. "Now let's try you on the rope tow." 
I stopped in my tracks, flushed and panting. 
"But Buddy, I don't know how to zigzag yet. All those people coming down from the top know how to zigzag." 
"Oh, you need only go halfway. Then you won't gain very much momentum." 
And Buddy accompanied me to the rope tow and showed me how to let the rope run through my hands, and then told me to close my fingers round it and go up. 
It never occurred to me to say no. 
I wrapped my fingers around the rough, bruising snake of a rope that slithered through them, and went up. 
But the rope dragged me, wobbling and balancing, so rapidly I couldn't hope to dissociate myself from it halfway. There was a skier in front of me and a skier behind me, and I'd have been knocked over and stuck full of skis and poles the minute I let go, and I didn't want to make trouble, so I hung quietly on. 
At the top, though, I had second thoughts. 
Buddy singled me out, hesitating there in the red jacket. His arms chopped the air like khaki windmills. Then I saw he was signaling me to come down a path that had opened in the middle of the weaving skiers. But as I poised, uneasy, with a dry throat, the smooth white path from my feet to his feet blurred. 
A skier crossed it from the left, another crossed it from the right, and Buddy's arms went on waving feebly as antennae from the other side of a field swarming with tiny moving animalcules like germs, or bent, bright exclamation marks. 
I looked up from that churning amphitheater to the view beyond it. 
The great, gray eye of the sky looked back at me, its mist-shrouded sun focusing all the white and silent distances that poured from every point of the compass, hill after pale hill, to stall at my feet. 
The interior voice nagging me not to be a fool -- to save my skin and take off my skis and walk down, camouflaged by the scrub pines bordering the slope -- fled like a disconsolate mosquito. The thought that I might kill myself formed in my mind coolly as a tree or a flower. 
I measured the distance to Buddy with my eye. 
His arms were folded, now, and he seemed of a piece with the split-rail fence behind him -- numb, brown and inconsequential. 
Edging to the rim of the hilltop, I dug the spikes of my poles into the snow and pushed myself into a flight I knew I couldn't stop by skill or any belated access of will. 
I aimed straight down. 
A keen wind that had been hiding itself struck me full in the mouth and raked the hair back horizontal on my head. I was descending, but the white sun rose no higher. It hung over the suspended waves of the hills, an insentient pivot without which the world would not exist. 
A small, answering point in my own body flew toward it. I felt my lungs inflate with the inrush of scenery -- air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, "This is what it is to be happy." 
I plummeted down past the zigzaggers, the students, the experts, through year after year of doubleness and smiles and compromise, into my own past. 
People and trees receded on either hand like the dark sides of a tunnel as I hurtled on to the still, bright point at the end of it, the pebble at the bottom of the well, the white sweet baby cradled in its mother's belly. 
My teeth crunched a gravelly mouthful. Ice water seeped down my throat. 
Buddy's face hung over me, near and huge, like a distracted planet. Other faces showed themselves up in back of his. Behind him, black dots swarmed on a plane of whiteness. Piece by piece, as at the strokes of a dull godmother's wand, the old world sprang back into position. 
"You were doing fine," a familiar voice informed my ear, "until that man stepped into your path." 
People were unfastening my bindings and collecting my ski poles from where they poked skyward, askew, in their separate snowbanks. The lodge fence propped itself at my back. 
Buddy bent to pull off my boots and the several pairs of white wool socks that padded them. His plump hand shut on my left foot, then inched up my ankle, closing and probing, as if feeling for a concealed weapon. 
A dispassionate white sun shone at the summit of the sky. I wanted to hone myself on it till I grew saintly and thin and essential as the blade of a knife. 
"I'm going up," I said. "I'm going to do it again." 
"No, you're not." 
A queer, satisfied expression came over Buddy's face. 
"No, you're not," he repeated with a final smile. "Your leg's broken in two places. You'll be stuck in a cast for months." 

Nine
 "I'm so GLAD THEY'RE GOING TO DIE." 
Hilda arched her cat-limbs in a yawn, buried her head in her arms on the conference table and went back to sleep. A wisp of bilious green straw perched on her brow like a tropical bird. 
Bile green. They were promoting it for fall, only Hilda, as usual, was half a year ahead of time. Bile green with black, bile green with white, bile green with nile green, its kissing cousin. 
Fashion blurbs, silver and full of nothing, sent up their fishy bubbles in my brain. They surfaced with a hollow pop. 
I'm so glad they're going to die. 
I cursed the luck that had timed my arrival in the hotel cafeteria to coincide with Hilda's. After a late night I felt too dull to think up the excuse that would take me back to my room for the glove, the handkerchief, the umbrella, the notebook I forgot. My penalty was the long, dead walk from the frosted glass doors of the Amazon to the strawberry-marble slab of our entry on Madison Avenue. 
Hilda moved like a mannequin the whole way. 
"That's a lovely hat, did you make it?" 
I half expected Hilda to turn on me and say, "You sound sick," but she only extended and then retracted her swanny neck. 
"Yes." 
The night before I'd seen a play where the heroine was possessed by a dybbuk, and when the dybbuk spoke from her mouth its voice sounded so cavernous and deep you couldn't tell whether it was a man or a woman. Well, Hilda's voice sounded just like the voice of that dybbuk. 
She stared at her reflection in the glossed shop windows as if to make sure, moment by moment, that she contained to exist. The silence between us was so profound I thought part of it must be my fault. 
So I said, "Isn't it awful about the Rosenbergs?" The Rosenbergs were to be electrocuted late that night.  
"Yes!" Hilda said, and at last I felt I had touched a human string in the cat's cradle of her heart. It was only as the two of us waited for the others in the tomblike morning gloom of the conference room that Hilda amplified that Yes of hers.  
"It's awful such people should be alive."  
She yawned then, and her pale orange mouth opened on a large darkness. Fascinated, I stared at the blind cave behind her face until the two lips met and moved and the dybbuk spoke out of its hiding place, "I'm so glad they're going to die." 
"Come on, give us a smile." 
I sat on the pink velvet loveseat in Jay Cee's office, holding a paper rose and facing the magazine photographer. I was the last of the twelve to have my picture taken. I had tried concealing myself in the powder room, but it didn't work. Betsy had spied my feet under the doors. 
I didn't want my picture taken because I was going to cry. I didn't know why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or looked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the sobs would fly out of my throat and I'd cry for a week. I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full 
This was the last round of photographs before the magazine went to press and we returned to Tulsa or Biloxi or Teaneck or Coos Bay or wherever we'd come from, and we were supposed to be photographed with props to show what we wanted to be. 
Betsy held an ear of corn to show she wanted to be a farmer's wife, and Hilda held the bald, faceless head of a hatmaker's dummy to show she wanted to design hats, and Doreen held a gold-embroidered sari to show she wanted to be a social worker in India (she didn't really, she told me, she only wanted to get her hands on a sari). 
When they asked me what I wanted to be I said I didn't know. 
"Oh, sure you know," the photographer said. 
"She wants," said Jay Cee wittily, "to be everything." 
I said I wanted to be a poet. 
Then they scouted about for something for me to hold. 
Jay Cee suggested a book of poems, but the photographer said no, that was too obvious. It should be something that showed what inspired the poems. Finally Jay Cee undipped the single, long-stemmed paper rose from her latest hat. 
The photographer fiddled with his hot white lights. "Show us how happy it makes you to write a poem." 
I stared through the frieze of rubber-plant leaves in Jay Cee's window to the blue sky beyond. A few stagey cloud puffs were traveling from right to left. I fixed my eyes on the largest cloud, as if, when it passed out of sight, I might have the good luck to pass with it. 
I felt it was very important to keep the line of my mouth level. 
"Give us a smile." 
At last, obediently, like the mouth of a ventriloquist's dummy, my own mouth started to quirk up. 
"Hey," the photographer protested, with sudden foreboding, "you look like you're going to cry." 
I couldn't stop. 
I buried my face in the pink velvet facade of Jay Cee's loveseat and with immense relief the salt tears and miserable noises that had been prowling around in me all morning burst out into the room. 
When I lifted my head, the photographer had vanished. Jay Cee had vanished as well. I felt limp and betrayed, like the skin shed by a terrible animal. It was a relief to be free of the animal, but it seemed to have taken my spirit with it, and everything else it could lay its paws on. 
I fumbled in my pocketbook for the gilt compact with the mascara and the mascara brush and the eyeshadow and the three lipsticks and the side mirror. The face that peered back at me seemed to be peering from the grating of a prison cell after a prolonged beating. It looked bruised and puffy and all the wrong colors. It was a face that needed soap and water and Christian tolerance. 
I started to paint it with small heart. 
Jay Cee breezed back after a decent interval with an armful of manuscripts. 
"These'll amuse you," she said. "Have a good read." 
Every morning a snowy avalanche of manuscripts swelled the dust-gray piles in the office of the Fiction Editor. Secretly, in studies and attics and schoolrooms all over America, people must be writing. Say someone or other finished a manuscript every minute; in five minutes that would be five manuscripts stacked on the Fiction Editor's desk. Within the hour there would be sixty, crowding each other onto the floor. And in a year. . . 
I smiled, seeing a pristine, imaginary manuscript floating in mid-air, with Esther Greenwood typed in the upper-right-hand corner. After my month on the magazine I'd applied for a summer school course with a famous writer where you sent in the manuscript of a story and he read it and said whether you were good enough to be admitted into his class. 
Of course, it was a very small class, and I had sent in my story a long time ago and hadn't heard from the writer yet, but I was sure I'd find the letter of acceptance waiting on the mail table at home. 
I decided I'd surprise Jay Cee and send in a couple of the stories I wrote in this class under a pseudonym. Then one day the Fiction Editor would come in to Jay Cee personally and plop the stories down on her desk and say, "Here's something a cut above the usual," and Jay Cee would agree and accept them and ask the author to lunch and it would be me. 
 "Honestly," Doreen said, "this one'll be different"  
"Tell me about him," I said stonily.  
 "He's from Peru." 
"They're squat," I said. "They're ugly as Aztecs."  
"No, no, no, sweetie, I've already met him."  
We were sitting on my bed in a mess of dirty cotton dresses and laddered nylons and gray underwear, and for ten minutes Doreen had been trying to persuade me to go to a country club dance with a friend of somebody Lenny knew which, she insisted, was a very different thing from a friend of Lenny's, but as I was catching the eight o'clock train home the next morning I felt I should make some attempt to pack 
I also had a dim idea that if I walked the streets of New York by myself all night something of the city's mystery and magnificence might rub off on to me at last 
But I gave it up. 
It was becoming more and more difficult for me to decide to do anything in those last days. And when I eventually did decide to do something, such as packing a suitcase, I only dragged all my grubby, expensive clothes out of the bureau and the closet and spread them on the chairs and the bed and the floor and then sat and stared at them, utterly perplexed. They seemed to have a separate, mulish identity of their own that refused to be washed and folded and stowed. 
"It's these clothes," I told Doreen. "I just can't face these clothes when I come back." 
 "That's easy." 
And in her beautiful, one-track way, Doreen started to snatch up slips and stockings and the elaborate strapless bra, full of steel springs -- a free gift from the Primrose Corset Company, which I'd never had the courage to wear -- and finally, one by one, the sad array of queerly cut forty-dollar dresses. . . 
"Hey, leave that one out. I'm wearing it." 
Doreen extricated a black scrap from her bundle and dropped it in my lap. Then, snowballing the rest of the clothes into one soft, conglomerate mass, she stuffed them out of sight under the bed. 
Doreen knocked on the green door with the gold knob. 
Scuffing and a man's laugh, cut short, sounded from inside. Then a tall boy in shirtsleeves and a blond crewcut inched the door open and peered out. 
 "Baby!" he roared. 
Doreen disappeared in his arms. I thought it must be the person Lenny knew. 
I stood quietly in the doorway in my black sheath and my black stole with the fringe, yellower than ever, but expecting less. "I am an observer," I told myself, as I watched Doreen being handed into the room by the blond boy to another man, who was also tall, but dark, with slightly longer hair. This man was wearing an immaculate white suit, a pale blue shirt and a yellow satin tie with a bright stickpin. 
I couldn't take my eyes off that stickpin. 
A great white light seemed to shoot out of it, illuminating the room. Then the light withdrew into itself, leaving a dewdrop on a field of gold. 
I put one foot in front of the other. 
"That's a diamond," somebody said, and a lot of people burst out laughing. 
My nail tapped a glassy facet 
"Her first diamond." 
"Give it to her, Marco." 
Marco bowed and deposited the stickpin in my palm. 
It dazzled and danced with light like a heavenly ice cube. I slipped it quickly into my imitation jet bead evening bag and looked around. The faces were empty as plates, and nobody seemed to be breathing. 
"Fortunately," a dry, hard hand encircled my upper arm, "I am escorting the lady for the rest of the evening. Perhaps," the spark in Marco's eyes extinguished, and they went black, "I shall perform some small service. . ." 
 Somebody laughed. 
". . .worthy of a diamond." 
The hand round my arm tightened. 
 "Ouch!" 
Marco removed his hand. I looked down at my arm. A fhumbprint purpled into view. Marco watched me. Then he pointed to the underside of my arm. "Look there." 
I looked, and saw four, faint matching prints. 
"You see, I am quite serious." 
Marco's small, flickering smile reminded me of a snake I'd teased in the Bronx Zoo. When I tapped my finger on the stout cage glass the snake had opened its clockwork jaws and seemed to smile. Then it struck and struck and struck at the invisible pane till I moved off. 
I had never met a woman-hater before. 
I could tell Marco was a woman-hater, because in spite of all the models and TV starlets in the room that night he paid attention to nobody but me. Not out of kindness or even curiosity, but because I'd happened to be dealt to him, like a playing card in a pack of identical cards. 
A man in the country club band stepped up to the mike and started shaking those seedpod rattles that mean South American music. 
Marco reached for my hand, but I hung on to my fourth daiquiri and stayed put. I'd never had a daiquiri before. The reason I had a daiquiri was because Marco ordered it for me, and I felt so grateful he hadn't asked what sort of drink I wanted that I didn't say a word, I just drank one daiquiri after another. 
Marco looked at me. 
"No," I said. 
"What do you mean, no?" 
"I can't dance to that kind of music." 
"Don't be stupid." 
"I want to sit here and finish my drink." 
Marco bent toward me with a tight smile, and in one swoop my drink took wing and landed in a potted palm. Then Marco gripped my hand in such a way I had to choose between following him on to the floor or having my arm torn off. 
"It's a tango." Marco maneuvered me out among the dancers. "I love tangos." 
"I can't dance." 
"You don't have to dance. I'll do the dancing." 
Marco hooked an arm around my waist and jerked me up against his dazzling white suit. Then he said, "Pretend you are drowning." 
I shut my eyes, and the music broke over me like a rainstorm. Marco's leg slid forward against mine and my leg slid back and I seemed to be riveted to him, limb for limb, moving as he moved, without any will or knowledge of my own, and after a while I thought, "It doesn't take two to dance, it only takes one," and I let myself blow and bend like a tree in the wind. 
"What did I tell you?" Marco's breath scorched my ear. "You're a perfectly respectable dancer." 
I began to see why woman-haters could make such fools of women. Woman-haters were like gods: invulnerable and chock-full of power. They descended, and then they disappeared. You could never catch one. 
After the South American music there was an interval 
Marco led me through the French doors into the garden. Lights and voices spilled from the ballroom window, but a few yards beyond the darkness drew up its barricade and sealed them off. In the infinitesimal glow of the stars, the trees and flowers were strewing their cool odors. There was no moon. 
The box hedges shut behind us. A deserted golf course stretched away toward a few hilly clumps of trees, and I felt the whole desolate familiarity of the scene -- the country club and the dance and the lawn with its single cricket. 
I didn't know where I was, but it was somewhere in the wealthy suburbs of New York. 
Marco produced a slim cigar and a silver lighter in the shape of a bullet. He set the cigar between his lips and bent over the small flare. His face, with its exaggerated shadows and planes of light, looked alien and pained, like a refugee's. 
I watched him. 
"Who are you in love with?" I said then. 
For a minute Marco didn't say anything, he simply opened his mouth and breathed out a blue, vaporous ring. 
"Perfect!" he laughed. 
The ring widened and blurred, ghost-pale on the dark air. 
Then he said, "I am in love with my cousin." 
I felt no surprise. 
"Why don't you marry her?" 
 "Impossible." 
 "Why?" 
Marco shrugged. "She's my first cousin. She's going to be a nun." 
"Is she beautiful?" 
"There's no one to touch her." 
"Does she know you love her?" 
 "Of course." 
I paused. The obstacle seemed unreal to me. 
"If you love her," I said, "you'll love somebody else someday." 
Marco dashed his cigar underfoot. 
The ground soared and struck me with a soft shock. Mud squirmed through my fingers. Marco waited until I half rose. Then he put both hands on my shoulders and flung me back. 
"My dress. . ." 
"Your dress!" The mud oozed and adjusted itself to my shoulder blades. "Your dress!" Marco's face lowered cloudily over mine. A few drops of spit struck my lips. "Your dress is black and the dirt is black as well." 
Then he threw himself face down as if he would grind his body through me and into the mud. 
"It's happening," I thought. "It's happening. If I just lie here and do nothing it will happen." 
Marco set his teeth to the strap at my shoulder and tore my sheath to the waist. I saw the glimmer of bare skin, like a pale veil separating two bloody-minded adversaries. 
 "Slut!" 
The words hissed by my ear. 
 "Slut!" 
The dust cleared, and I had a full view of the battle. 
I began to writhe and bite. 
Marco weighed me to the earth. 
 "Slut!" 
I gouged at his leg with the sharp heel of my shoe. He turned, fumbling for the hurt. 
Then I fisted my fingers together and smashed them at his nose. It was like hitting the steel plate of a battleship. Marco sat up. I began to cry. 
Marco pulled out a white handkerchief and dabbed his nose. Blackness, like ink, spread over the pale cloth. 
I sucked at my salty knuckles. 
"I want Doreen." 
Marco stared off across the golf links. 
"I want Doreen. I want to go home." 
"Sluts, all sluts." Marco seemed to be talking to nimself. "Yes or no, it is all the same."  
I poked Marco's shoulder. "Where's Doreen?" 
Marco snorted. "Go to the parking lot. Look in the backs of all the cars."  
Then he spun around. 
 "My diamond." 
I got up and retrieved my stole from the darkness. I started to walk off. Marco sprang to his feet and blocked my path. Then, deliberately, he wiped his finger under his bloody nose and with two strokes stained my cheeks. "I have earned my diamond with this blood. Give it to me." 
"I don't know where it is." 
Now I knew perfectly well that the diamond was in my evening bag and that when Marco knocked me down my evening bag had soared, like a night bird, into the enveloping darkness. I began to think I would lead him away and then return on my own and hunt for it. 
I had no idea what a diamond that size would buy, but whatever it was, I knew it would be a lot. Marco took my shoulders in both hands. "Tell me," he said, giving each word equal emphasis. "Tell me, or I'll break your neck." Suddenly I didn't care. 
"It's in my imitation jet bead evening bag," I said. "Somewhere in the muck." 
I left Marco on his hands and knees, scrabbling in the darkness for another, smaller darkness that hid the light of his diamond from his furious eyes. 
Doreen was not in the ballroom nor in the parking lot. I kept to the fringe of the shadows so nobody would notice the grass plastered to my dress and shoes, and with my black stole I covered my shoulders and bare breasts. 
Luckily for me, the dance was nearly over, and groups of people were leaving and coming out to the parked cars. I asked at one car after another until finally I found a car that had room and would drop me in the middle of Manhattan. 
At that vague hour between dark and dawn, the sunroof of the Amazon was deserted. 
Quiet as a burglar in my cornflower-sprigged bathrobe, I crept to the edge of the parapet. The parapet reached almost to my shoulders, so I dragged a folding chair from the stack against the wall, opened it, and climbed onto the precarious seat. 
A stiff breeze lifted the hair from my head. At my feet, the city doused its lights in sleep, its buildings blackened, as if for a funeral. 
It was my last night. 
I grasped the bundle I carried and pulled at a pale tail. A strapless elasticized slip which, in the course of wear, had lost its elasticity, slumped into my hand. I waved it, like a flag of truce, once, twice. . . The breeze caught it, and I let go. 
A white flake floated out into the night, and began its slow descent. I wondered on what street or rooftop it would come to rest. 
I tugged at the bundle again. 
The wind made an effort, but failed, and a batlike shadow sank toward the roof garden of the penthouse opposite. 
Piece by piece, I fed my wardrobe to the night wind, and flutteringly, like a loved one's ashes, the gray scraps were ferried off, to settle here, there, exactly where I would never know, in the dark heart of New York. 
Ten
 THE FACE IN THE MIRROR looked like a sick Indian. 
I dropped the compact into my pocketbook and stared out of the train window. Like a colossal junkyard, the swamps and back lots of Connecticut flashed past, one broken-down fragment bearing no relation to another. 
What a hotchpotch the world was! 
I glanced down at my unfamiliar skirt and blouse. 
The skirt was a green dirndl with tiny black, white and electric-blue shapes swarming across it, and it stuck out like a lampshade. Instead of sleeves, the white eyelet blouse had frills at the shoulder, floppy as the wings of a new angel. 
I'd forgotten to save any day clothes from the ones I let fly over New York, so Betsy had traded me a blouse and skirt for my bathrobe with the cornflowers on it. 
A wan reflection of myself, white wings, brown ponytail and all, ghosted over the landscape. 
"Pollyanna Cowgirl," I said out loud. 
A woman in the seat opposite looked up from her magazine. 
I hadn't, at the last moment, felt like washing off the two diagonal lines of dried blood that marked my cheeks. They seemed touching, and rather spectacular, and I thought I would carry them around with me, like the relic of a dead lover, till they wore off of their own accord. 
Of course, if I smiled or moved my face much, the blood would flake away in no time, so I kept my face immobile, and when I had to speak I spoke through my teeth, without disturbing my lips. 
I didn't really see why people should look at me. 
Plenty of people looked queerer than I did. 
My gray suitcase rode on the rack over my head, empty except for The Thirty Best Short Stories of the Year, a white plastic sunglasses case and two dozen avocado pears, a parting present from Doreen. 
The pears were unripe, so they would keep well, and whenever I lifted my suitcase up or down or simply carried it along, they cannoned from one end to the other with a special little thunder of their own. 
"Root Wan Twenny Ate!" the conductor bawled. 
The domesticated wilderness of pine, maple and oak rolled to a halt and stuck in the frame of the train window like a bad picture. My suitcase grumbled and bumped as I negotiated the long aisle. 
I stepped from the air-conditioned compartment onto the station platform, and the motherly breath of the suburbs enfolded me. It smelt of lawn sprinklers and station wagons and tennis rackets and dogs and babies. 
A summer calm laid its soothing hand over everything, like death. 
My mother was waiting by the glove-gray Chevrolet. 
"Why lovey, what's happened to your face?" 
"Cut myself," I said briefly, and crawled into the back seat after my suitcase. I didn't want her staring at me the whole way home. 
The upholstery felt slippery and clean. 
My mother climbed behind the wheel and tossed a few letters into my lap, then turned her back 
The car purred into life. 
"I think I should tell you right away," she said, and I could see bad news in the set of her neck, "you didn't make that writing course." 
The air punched out of my stomach. 
All through June the writing course stretched before me like a bright, safe bridge over the dull gulf of the summer. Now I saw it totter and dissolve, and a body in a white blouse and green skirt plummet into the gap. 
Then my mouth shaped itself sourly. 
I had expected it. 
I slunk down on the middle of my spine, my nose level with the rim of the window, and watched the houses of outer Boston glide by. As the houses grew more familiar I slunk still lower. 
I felt it was very important not to be recognized. 
The gray, padded car roof closed over my head like the roof of a prison van, and the white, shining, identical clapboard houses with their interstices of well-groomed green proceeded past, one bar after another in a large but escape-proof cage. 
I had never spent a summer in the suburbs before. 
The soprano screak of carriage wheels punished my ear. Sun, seeping through the blinds, filled the bedroom with a sulphurous light. I didn't know how long I had slept, but I felt one big twitch of exhaustion. 
The twin bed next to mine was empty and unmade. 
At seven I had heard my mother get up, slip into her clothes and tiptoe out of the room. Then the buzz of the orange squeezer sounded from downstairs, and the smell of coffee and bacon filtered under my door. Then the sink water ran from the tap and dishes clinked as my mother dried them and put them back in the cupboard. 
Then the front door opened and shut. Then the car door opened and shut, and the motor went broom-broom and, edging off with a crunch of gravel, faded into the distance. 
My mother was teaching shorthand and typing to a lot of city college girls and wouldn't be home till the middle of the afternoon. 
The carriage wheels screaked past again. Somebody seemed to be wheeling a baby back and forth under my window. 
I slipped out of bed and onto the rug, and quietly, on my hands and knees, crawled over to see who it was. 
Ours was a small, white clapboard house set in the middle of a small green lawn on the corner of two peaceful suburban streets, but in spite of the little maple trees planted at intervals around our property, anybody passing along the sidewalk could glance up at the second story windows and see just what was going on. 
This was brought home to me by our next-door neighbor, a spiteful woman named Mrs. Ockenden. 
Mrs. Ockenden was a retired nurse who had just married her third husband -- the other two died in curious circumstances -- and she spent an inordinate amount of time peering from behind the starched white curtains of her windows. 
She had called my mother up twice about me -- once to report that I had been sitting in front of the house for an hour under the streetlight and kissing somebody in a blue Plymouth, and once to say that I had better pull the blinds down in my room, because she had seen me half-naked getting ready for bed one night when she happened to be out walking her Scotch terrier. 
With great care, I raised my eyes to the level of the windowsill. 
A woman not five feet tall, with a grotesque, protruding stomach, was wheeling an old black baby carriage down the street. Two or three small children of various sizes, all pale, with smudgy faces and bare smudgy knees, wobbled along in the shadow of her skirts. 
A serene, almost religious smile lit up the woman's face. Her head tilted happily back, like a sparrow egg perched on a duck egg, she smiled into the sun. 
I knew the woman well 
It was Dodo Conway. 
Dodo Conway was a Catholic who had gone to Barnard and then married an architect who had gone to Columbia and was also a Catholic. They had a big, rambling house up the street from us, set behind a morbid facade of pine trees, and surrounded by scooters, tricycles, doll carriages, toy fire trucks, baseball bats, badminton nets, croquet wickets, hamster cages and cocker spaniel puppies -- the whole sprawling paraphernalia of suburban childhood. 
Dodo interested me in spite of myself. 
Her house was unlike all the others in our neighborhood in its size (it was much bigger) and its color (the second story was constructed of dark brown clapboard and the first of gray stucco, studded with gray and purple golfball-shaped stones), and the pine trees completely screened it from view, which was considered unsociable in our community of adjoining lawns and friendly, waist-high hedges. 
Dodo raised her six children -- and would no doubt raise her seventh -- on Rice Krispies, peanut-butter-and-marshmallow sandwiches, vanilla ice cream and gallon upon gallon of Hoods milk. She got a special discount from the local milkman. 
Everybody loved Dodo, although the swelling size of her family was the talk of the neighborhood. The older people around, like my mother, had two children, and the younger, more prosperous ones had four, but nobody but Dodo was on the verge of a seventh. Even six was considered excessive, but then, everybody said, of course Dodo was a Catholic. 
I watched Dodo wheel the youngest Conway up and down. She seemed to be doing it for my benefit. Children made me sick. 
A floorboard creaked, and I ducked down again, just as Dodo Conway's face, by instinct, or some gift of supernatural hearing, turned on the little pivot of its neck. 
I felt her gaze pierce through the white clapboard and the pink wallpaper roses and uncover me, crouching there behind the silver pickets of the radiator. 
I crawled back into bed and pulled the sheet over my head. But even that didn't shut out the light, so I buried my head under the darkness of the pillow and pretended it was night. I couldn't see the point of getting up. I had nothing to look forward to. 
After a while I heard the telephone ringing in the downstairs hall. I stuffed the pillow into my ears and gave myself five minutes. Then I lifted my head from its bolt hole. The ringing had stopped. 
Almost at once it started up again. 
Cursing whatever friend, relative or stranger had sniffed out my homecoming, I padded barefoot downstairs. The black instrument on the hall table trilled its hysterical note over and over, like a nervous bird. I picked up the receiver. "Hullo," I said, in a low, disguised voice. "Hullo, Esther, what's the matter, have you got laryngitis?" It was my old friend Jody, calling from Cambridge. Jody was working at the Coop that summer and taking a lunchtime course in sociology. She and two other girls from my college had rented a big apartment from four Harvard law students, and I'd been planning to move in with them when my writing course began.  
Jody wanted to know when they could expect me. 
"I'm not coming," I said. "I didn't make the course." 
There was a small pause. 
"He's an ass," Jody said then. "He doesn't know a good thing when he sees it." 
"My sentiments exactly." My voice sounded strange and hollow in my ears. 
"Come anyway. Take some other course." 
The notion of studying German or abnormal psychology flitted through my head. After all, I'd saved nearly the whole of my New York salary, so I could just about afford it 
But the hollow voice said, "You better count me out." 
"Well," Jody began, "there's this other girl who wanted to come in with us if anybody dropped out. . ." 
"Fine. Ask her." 
The minute I hung up I knew I should have said I would come. One morning listening to Dodo Conway's baby carriage would drive me crazy. And I made a point of never living in the same house with my mother for more than a week. 
I reached for the receiver. 
My hand advanced a few inches, then retreated and fell limp. I forced it toward the receiver again, but again it stopped short, as if it had collided with a pane of glass. 
I wandered into the dining room. 
Propped on the table I found a long, businesslike letter from the summer school and a thin blue letter on leftover Yale stationery, addressed to me in Buddy Willard's lucid hand. 
I slit open the summer school letter with a knife. 
Since I wasn't accepted for the writing course, it said, I could choose some other course instead, but I should call in to the Admissions Office that same morning, or it would be too late to register, the courses were almost full. 
I dialed the Admissions Office and listened to the zombie voice leave a message that Miss Esther Greenwood was canceling all arrangements to come to summer school 
Then I opened Buddy Willard's letter. 
Buddy wrote that he was probably falling in love with a nurse who also had TB, but his mother had rented a cottage in the Adirondacks for the month of July, and if I came along with her, he might well find his feeling for the nurse was mere infatuation. 
I snatched up a pencil and crossed out Buddy's message. Then I turned the letter paper over and on the opposite side wrote that I was engaged to a simultaneous interpreter and never wanted to see Buddy again as I did not want to give my children a hypocrite for a father. 
I stuck the letter back in the envelope, Scotch-taped it together, and readdressed it to Buddy, without putting on a new stamp. I thought the message was worth a good three cents. 
Then I decided I would spend the summer writing a novel 
That would fix a lot of people. 
I strolled into the kitchen, dropped a raw egg into a teacup of raw hamburger, mixed it up and ate it. Then I set up the card table on the screened breezeway between the house and the garage. 
A great wallowing bush of mock orange shut off the view of the street in front, the house wall and the garage wall took care of either side, and a clump of birches and a box hedge protected me from Mrs. Ockenden at the back. 
I counted out three hundred and fifty sheets of corrasable bond from my mother's stock in the hall closet, secreted away under a pile of old felt hats and clothes brushes and woolen scarves. 
Back on the breezeway, I fed the first, virgin sheet into my old portable and rolled it up. 
From another, distanced mind, I saw myself sitting on the breezeway, surrounded by two white clapboard walls, a mock orange bush and a clump of birches and a box hedge, small as a doll in a doll's house. 
A feeling of tenderness filled my heart. My heroine would be myself, only in disguise. She would be called Elaine. Elaine. I counted the letters on my fingers. There were six letters in Esther, too. It seemed a lucky thing. 
Elaine sat on the breezeway in an old yellow nightgown of her mother's waiting for something to happen. It was a sweltering morning in July, and drops of sweat crawled down her back one by one, like slow insects. 
I leaned back and read what I had written. 
It seemed lively enough, and I was quite proud of the bit about the drops of sweat like insects, only I had the dim impression I'd probably read it somewhere else a long time ago. 
I sat like that for about an hour, trying to think what would come next, and in my mind, the barefoot doll in her mother's old yellow nightgown sat and stared into space as well. 
"Why, honey, don't you want to get dressed?" 
My mother took care never to tell me to do anything. She would only reason with me sweetly, like one intelligent mature person with another. 
"It's almost three in the afternoon." 
"I'm writing a novel," I said. "I haven't got time to change out of this and change into that." 
I lay on the couch on the breezeway and shut my eyes. I could hear my mother clearing the typewriter and the papers from the card table and laying out the silver for supper, but I didn't move. 
Inertia oozed like molasses through Elaine's limbs. That's what it must feel like to have malaria, she thought. 
At any rate, I'd be lucky if I wrote a page a day. 
Then I knew what the trouble was. 
I needed experience. 
How could I write about life when I'd never had a love affair or a baby or even seen anybody die? A girl I knew had just won a prize for a short story about her adventures among the pygmies in Africa. How could I compete with that sort of thing? 
By the end of supper my mother had convinced me I should study shorthand in the evenings. Then I would be killing two birds with one stone, writing a novel and learning something practical as well. I would also be saving a whole lot of money. 
That same evening, my mother unearthed an old blackboard from the cellar and set it up on the breezeway. Then she stood at the blackboard and scribbled little curlicues in white chalk while I sat in a chair and watched. 
At first I felt hopeful. 
I thought I might learn shorthand in no time, and when the freckled lady in the Scholarships Office asked me why I hadn't worked to earn money in July and August, the way you were supposed to if you were a scholarship girl, I could tell her I had taken a free shorthand course instead, so I could support myself right after college. 
The only thing was, when I tried to picture myself in some job, briskly jotting down line after line of shorthand, my mind went blank. There wasn't one job I felt like doing where you used shorthand. And, as I sat there and watched, the white chalk curlicues blurred into senselessness. 
I told my mother I had a terrible headache, and went to bed. 
An hour later the door inched open, and she crept into the room. I heard the whisper of her clothes as she undressed. She climbed into bed. Then her breathing grew slow and regular. 
In the dim light of the streetlamp that filtered through the drawn blinds, I could see the pin curls on her head glittering like a row of little bayonets. 
I decided I would put off the novel until I had gone to Europe and had a lover, and that I would never learn a word of shorthand. If I never learned shorthand I would never have to use it. 
I thought I would spend the summer reading Ftnnegans Wake and writing my thesis. 
Then I would be way ahead when college started at the end of September, and able to enjoy my last year instead of swotting away with no makeup and stringy hair, on a diet of coffee and Benzedrine, the way most of the seniors taking honors did, until they finished their thesis. 
Then I thought I might put off college for a year and apprentice myself to a pottery maker. 
Or work my way to Germany and be a waitress, until I was bilingual. 
Then plan after plan started leaping through my head, like a family of scatty rabbits. 
I saw the years of my life spaced along a road in the form of telephone poles, threaded together by wires. I counted one, two, three. . . nineteen telephone poles, and then the wires dangled into space, and try as I would, I couldn't see a single pole beyond the nineteenth. 
The room blued into view, and I wondered where the night had gone. My mother turned from a foggy log into a slumbering, middle-aged woman, her mouth slightly open and a snore raveling from her throat. The piggish noise irritated me, and for a while it seemed to me that the only way to stop it would be to take the column of skin and sinew from which it rose and twist it to silence between my hands. 
I feigned sleep until my mother left for school, but even my eyelids didn't shut out the light. They hung the raw, red screen of their tiny vessels in front of me like a wound. I crawled between the mattress and the padded bedstead and let the mattress fall across me like a tombstone. It felt dark and safe under there, but the mattress was not heavy enough. 
It needed about a ton more weight to make me sleep. 
riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs. . . 
The thick book made an unpleasant dent in my stomach.  
riverrun, past Eve and Adam's. . . 
I thought the small letter at the start might mean that nothing ever really began all new, with a capital, but that it just flowed on from what came before. Eve and Adam's was Adam and Eve, or course, but it probably signified something else as well. 
Maybe it was a pub in Dublin. 
My eyes sank through an alphabet soup of letters to the long word in the middle of the page. 
bababadalgharaghtakammmarronnkonnbronntonnerronnttionnthunntrovarrhoun awnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk! 
I counted the letters. There were exactly a hundred of them. I thought this must be important. 
Why should there be a hundred letters? 
Haltingly, I tried the word aloud. 
It sounded like a heavy wooden object falling downstairs, boomp boomp boomp, step after step. Lifting the pages of the book, I let them fan slowly by my eyes. Words, dimly familiar but twisted all awry, like faces in a funhouse mirror, fled past, leaving no impression on the glassy surface of my brain. 
I squinted at the page. 
The letters grew barbs and rams' horns. I watched them separate, each from the other, and jiggle up and down in a silly way. Then they associated themselves in fantastic, untranslatable shapes, like Arabic or Chinese. 
I decided to junk my thesis. 
I decided to junk the whole honors program and become an ordinary English major. I went to look up the requirements of an ordinary English major at my college. 
There were lots of requirements, and I didn't have half of them. One of the requirements was a course in the eighteenth century. I hated the very idea of the eighteenth century, with all those smug men writing tight little couplets and being so dead keen on reason. So I'd skipped it. They let you do that in honors, you were much freer. I had been so free I'd spent most of my time on Dylan Thomas. 
A friend of mine, also in honors, had managed never to read a word of Shakespeare; but she was a real expert on the Four Quartets. 
I saw how impossible and embarrassing it would be for me to try to switch from my free program into the stricter one. So I looked up the requirements for English majors at the city college where my mother taught. 
They were even worse. 
You had to know Old English and the History of the English Language and a representative selection of all that had been written from Beowulf to the present day. 
This surprised me. I had always looked down on my mother's college, as it was coed, and filled with people who couldn't get scholarships to the big eastern colleges. 
Now I saw that the stupidest person at my mother's college knew more than I did. I saw they wouldn't even let me in through the door, let alone give me a large scholarship like the one I had at my own college. 
I thought I'd better go to work for a year and think things over. Maybe I could study the eighteenth century in secret. 
But I didn't know shorthand, so what could I do? 
I could be a waitress or a typist. 
But I couldn't stand the idea of being either one. 
"You say you want more sleeping pills?" 
"Yes." 
"But the ones I gave you last week are very strong." 
"They don't work any more." 
Teresa's large, dark eyes regarded me thoughtfully. I could hear the voices of her three children in the garden under the consulting-room window. My Aunt Libby had married an Italian, and Teresa was my aunt's sister-in-law and our family doctor. 
I liked Teresa. She had a gentle, intuitive touch. 
I thought it must be because she was Italian. 
There was a little pause. 
"What seems to be the matter?" Teresa said then. 
"I can't sleep. I can't read." I tried to speak in a cool, calm way, but the zombie rose up in my throat and choked me off. I turned my hands palm up. 
"I think," Teresa tore off a white slip from her prescription pad and wrote down a name and address, "you'd better see another doctor I know. He'll be able to help you more than I can." 
I peered at the writing, but I couldn't read it. 
"Doctor Gordon," Teresa said. "He's a psychiatrist." 

Eleven
 DOCTOR GORDON'S WAITING ROOM was hushed and beige. 
The walls were beige, and the carpets were beige, and the upholstered chairs and sofas were beige. There were no mirrors or pictures, only certificates from different medical schools, with Doctor Gordon's name in Latin, hung about the walls. Pale green loopy ferns and spiked leaves of a much darker green filled the ceramic pots on the end table and the coffee table and the magazine table. 
At first I wondered why the room felt so safe. Then I realized it was because there were no windows. 
The air-conditioning made me shiver. 
I was still wearing Betsy's white blouse and dirndl skirt. They drooped a bit now, as I hadn't washed them in my three weeks at home. The sweaty cotton gave off a sour but friendly smell. 
I hadn't washed my hair for three weeks, either. 
I hadn't slept for seven nights. 
My mother told me I must have slept, it was impossible not to sleep in all that time, but if I slept, it was with my eyes wide open, for I had followed the green, luminous course of the second hand and the minute hand and the hour hand of the bedside clock through their circles and semi-circles, every night for seven nights, without missing a second, or a minute, or an hour. 
The reason I hadn't washed my clothes or my hair was because it seemed so silly. 
I saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright, white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a black shade. Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue. 
It seemed silly to wash one day when I would only have to wash again the next. 
It made me tired just to think of it. 
I wanted to do everything once and for all and be through with it. 
Doctor Gordon twiddled a silver pencil 
"Your mother tells me you are upset." 
I curled in the cavernous leather chair and faced Doctor Gordon across an acre of highly polished desk. 
Doctor Gordon waited. He tapped his pencil -- tap, tap, tap -- across the neat green field of his blotter. 
His eyelashes were so long and thick they looked artificial. Black plastic reeds fringing two green, glacial pools. 
Doctor Gordon's features were so perfect he was almost pretty. 
I hated him the minute I walked in through the door. 
I had imagined a kind, ugly, intuitive man looking up and saying "Ah!" in an encoraging way, as if he could see something I couldn't, and then I would find words to tell him how I was so scared, as if I were being stuffed farther and farther into a black, airless sack with no way out. 
Then he would lean back in his chair and match the tips of his fingers together in a little steeple and tell me why I couldn't sleep and why I couldn't read and why I couldn't eat and why everything people did seemed so silly, because they only died in the end. 
And then, I thought, he would help me, step by step, to be myself again. 
But Doctor Gordon wasn't like that at all. He was young and good-looking, and I could see right away he was conceited. 
Doctor Gordon had a photograph on his desk, in a silver frame, that half faced him and half faced my leather chair. It was a family photograph, and it showed a beautiful dark-haired woman, who could have been Doctor Gordon's sister, smiling out over the heads of two blond children. 
I think one child was a boy and one was a girl, but it may have been that both children were boys or that both were girls, it is hard to tell when children are so small. I think there was also a dog in the picture, toward the bottom -- a kind of airedale or a golden retriever -- but it may have only been the pattern in the woman's skirt. 
For some reason the photograph made me furious. 
I didn't see why it should be turned half toward me unless Doctor Gordon was trying to show me right away that he was married to some glamorous woman and I'd better not get any funny ideas. 
Then I thought, how could this Doctor Gordon help me anyway, with a beautiful wife and beautiful children and a beautiful dog haloing him like the angels on a Christmas card? 
"Suppose you try and tell me what you think is wrong." 
I turned the words over suspiciously, like round, sea-polished pebbles that might suddenly put out a claw and change into something else. 
What did I think was wrong? 
That made it sound as if nothing was really wrong, I only thought it was wrong. 
In a dull, flat voice -- to show I was not beguiled by his good looks or his family photograph -- I told Doctor Gordon about not sleeping and not eating and not reading. I didn't tell him about the handwriting, which bothered me most of all. 
That morning I had tried to write a letter to Doreen, down in West Virginia, asking whether I could come and live with her and maybe get a job at her college waiting on table or something. 
But when I took up my pen, my hand made big, jerky letters like those of a child, and the lines sloped down the page from left to right almost diagonally, as if they were loops of string lying on the paper, and someone had come along and blown them askew. 
I knew I couldn't send a letter like that, so I tore it up in little pieces and put them in my pocketbook, next to my all-purpose compact, in case the psychiatrist asked to see them. 
But of course Doctor Gordon didn't ask to see them, as I hadn't mentioned them, and I began to feel pleased at my cleverness. I thought I only need tell him what I wanted to, and that I could control the picture he had of me by hiding this and revealing that, all the while he thought he was so smart. 
The whole time I was talking, Doctor Gordon bent his head as if he were praying, and the only noise apart from the dull, flat voice was the tap, tap, tap of Doctor Gordon's pencil at the same point on the green blotter, like a stalled walking stick. 
When I had finished, Doctor Gordon lifted his head. ''Where did you say you went to college?" Baffled, I told him. I didn't see where college fitted in. "Ah!" Doctor Gordon leaned back in his chair, staring into the air over my shoulder with a reminiscent smile. 
I thought he was going to tell me his diagnosis, and that perhaps I had judged him too hastily and too unkindly. But he only said, "I remember your college well. I was up there, during the war. They had a WAC station, didn't they? Or was it WAVES?" 
I said I didn't know. 
"Yes, a WAC station, I remember now. I was doctor for the lot, before I was sent overseas. My, they were a pretty bunch of girls." 
Doctor Gordon laughed. 
Then, in one smooth move, he rose to his feet and strolled toward me round the corner of his desk. I wasn't sure what he meant to do, so I stood up as well. 
Doctor Gordon reached for the hand that hung at my right side and shook it. 
"See you next week, then." 
The full, bosomy elms made a tunnel of shade over the yellow and red brick fronts along Commonwealth Avenue, and a trolley car was threading itself toward Boston down its slim, silver track. I waited for the trolley to pass, then crossed to the gray Chevrolet at the opposite curb. 
I could see my mother's face, anxious and sallow as a slice of lemon, peering up at me through the windshield.  
"Well, what did he say?" 
I pulled the car door shut. It didn't catch. I pushed it out and drew it in again with a dull slam. 
"He said he'll see me next week." 
My mother sighed. 
Doctor Gordon cost twenty-five dollars an hour. 
"Hi there, what's your name?"
 "Elly Higginbottom." 
The sailor fell into step beside me, and I smiled. 
I thought there must be as many sailors on the Common as there were pigeons. 
They seemed to come out of a dun-colored recruiting house on the far side, with blue and 
white "Join the Navy" posters stuck up on billboards round it and all over the inner walls. 
"Where do you come from, Elly?" 
"Chicago." 
I had never been to Chicago, but I knew one or two boys who went to Chicago University, and it seemed the sort of place where unconventional, mixed-up people would come from. 
"You sure are a long way from home." 
The sailor put his arm around my waist, and for a long time we walked around the Common like that, the sailor stroking my hip through the green dirndl skirt, and me smiling mysteriously and trying not to say anything that would show I was from Boston and might at any moment meet Mrs. Willard, or one of my mother's other friends, crossing the Common after tea on Beacon Hill or shopping in Filene's Basement. 
I thought if I ever did get to Chicago, I might change my name to Elly Higginbottom for good. Then nobody would know I had thrown up a scholarship at a big eastern women's college and mucked up a month in New York and refused a perfectly solid medical student for a husband who would one day be a member of the AMA and earn pots of money. 
In Chicago, people would take me for what I was.  
I would be simple Elly Higgenbottom, the orphan. People would love me for my sweet, quiet nature. They wouldn't be after me to read books and write long papers on the twins in James Joyce. And one day I might just marry a virile, but tender, garage mechanic and have a big cowy family, like Dodo Conway. 
If I happened to feel like it. 
"What do you want to do when you get out of the Navy?" I asked the sailor suddenly. 
It was the longest sentence I had said, and he seemed taken aback. He pushed his white cupcake cap to one side and scratched his head. 
"Well, I dunno, Elly," he said. "I might just go to college on the G.I. Bill" 
I paused. Then I said suggestively, "You ever thought of opening a garage?" 
"Nope," said the sailor. "Never have." 
I peered at him from the corner of my eye. He didn't look a day over sixteen. 
"Do you know how old I am?" I said accusingly. 
The sailor grinned at me. "Nope, and I don't care either." 
It occurred to me that this sailor was really remarkably handsome. He looked Nordic and virginal. Now I was simple-minded it seemed I attracted clean, handsome people. 
"Well, I'm thirty," I said, and waited. 
"Gee, Elly, you don't look it." The sailor squeezed my hip. 
Then he glanced quickly from left to right. "Listen, Elly, if we go round to those steps over there, under the monument, I can kiss you." 
At that moment I noticed a brown figure in sensible flat brown shoes striding across the Common in my direction. From the distance, I couldn't make out any features on the dime-sized face, but I knew it was Mrs. Willard. 
"Could you please tell me the way to the subway?" I said to the sailor in a loud voice. 
 "Huh?" 
"The subway that goes out to the Deer Island Prison?" 
When Mrs. Willard came up I would have to pretend I was only asking the sailor directions, and didn't really know him at all. 
"Take your hands off me," I said between my teeth. 
"Say, Elly, what's up?" 
The woman approached and passed by without a look or a nod, and of course it wasn't Mrs. Willard. Mrs. Willard was at her cottage in the Adirondacks. 
I fixed the woman's receding back with a vengeful stare. 
"Say, Elly. . ." 
"I thought it was somebody I knew," I said. "Some blasted lady from this orphan home in Chicago." 
The sailor put his arm around me again. 
"You mean you got no mom and dad, Elly?" 
"No." I let out a tear that seemed ready. It made a little hot track down my cheek. 
"Say, Elly, don't cry. This lady, was she mean to you?" 
"She was. . . she was awful." 
The tears came in a rush, then, and while the sailor was holding me and patting them dry with a big, clean, white linen handkerchief in the shelter of an American elm, I thought what an awful woman that lady in the brown suit had been, and how she, whether she knew it or not, was responsible for my taking the wrong turn here and the wrong path there and for everything bad that happened after that. 
"Well, Esther, how do you feel this week?" 
Doctor Gordon cradled his pencil like a slim, silver bullet. 
 "The same." 
"The same?" He quirked an eyebrow, as if he didn't believe it. 
So I told him again, in the same dull, flat voice, only it was angrier this time, because he seemed so slow to understand, how I hadn't slept for fourteen nights and how I couldn't read or write or swallow very well. 
Doctor Gordon seemed unimpressed. 
I dug into my pocketbook and found the scraps of my letter to Doreen. I took them out and let them flutter on to Doctor Gordon's immaculate green blotter. They lay there, dumb as daisy petals in a summer meadow. 
"What," I said, "do you think of that?" 
I thought Doctor Gordon must immediately see how bad the handwriting was, but he only said, "I think I would like to speak to your mother. Do you mind?" 
"No." But I didn't like the idea of Doctor Gordon talking to my mother one bit. I thought he might tell her I should be locked up. I picked up every scrap of my letter to Doreen, so Doctor Gordon couldn't piece them together and see I was planning to run away, and walked out of his office without another word. 
I watched my mother grow smaller and smaller until she disappeared into the door of Doctor Gordon's office building. Then I watched her grow larger and larger as she came back to the car. 
"Well?" I could tell she had been crying. 
My mother didn't look at me. She started the car. 
Then she said, as we glided under the cool, deep-sea shade of the elms, "Doctor Gordon doesn't think you've improved at all. He thinks you should have some shock treatments at his private hospital in Walton." 
I felt a sharp stab of curiosity, as if I had just read a terrible newspaper headline about somebody else. 
"Does he mean live there?" 
"No," my mother said, and her chin quivered. 
I thought she must be lying. 
"You tell me the truth," I said, "or I'll never speak to you again." 
 "Don't I always tell you the truth?" my mother said, and burst into tears. 
SUICIDE SAVED FROM 7-STORY LEDGE! 
After two hours on a narrow ledge seven stories above a concrete parking lot and gathered crowds, Mr. George Pollucci let himself be helped to safety through a nearby window by Sgt. Will Kilmartin of the Charles Street police force. 
I cracked open a peanut from the ten-cent bag I had bought to feed the pigeons, and ate it. It tasted dead, like a bit of old tree bark. 
I brought the newspaper close up to my eyes to get a better view of George Pollucci's face, spotlighted lie a three-quarter moon against a vague background of brick and black sky. I felt he had something important to tell me, and whatever it was might just be written on his face. 
But the smudgy crags of George Pollucci's features melted away as I peered at them, and resolved themselves into a regular pattern of dark and light and medium-gray dots. 
The inky-black newspaper paragraph didn't tell why Mr. Pollucci was on the ledge, or what Sgt. Kilmartin did to him when he finally got him in through the window. 
The trouble about jumping was that if you didn't pick the right number of stories, you might still be alive when you hit bottom. I thought seven stories must be a safe distance. 
I folded the paper and wedged it between the slats of the park bench. It was what my mother called a scandal sheet, full of the local murders and suicides and beatings and robbings, and just about every page had a half-naked lady on it with her breasts surging over the edge of her dress and her legs arranged so you could see to her stocking tops. 
I didn't know why I had never bought any of these papers before. They were the only things I could read. The little paragraphs between the pictures ended before the letters had a chance to get cocky and wiggle about. At home, all I ever saw was the Christian Science Monitor, which appeared on the doorstep at five o'clock every day but Sunday and treated suicides and sex crimes and airplane crashes as if they didn't happen. 
A big white swan full of little children approached my bench, then turned around a bosky islet covered with ducks and paddled back under the dark arch of the bridge. Everything I looked at seemed bright and extremely tiny. 
I saw, as if through the keyhole of a door I couldn't open, myself and my younger brother, knee-high and holding rabbit-eared balloons, climb aboard a swanboat and fight for a seat at the edge, over the peanut-shell-paved water. My mouth tasted of cleanness and peppermint. If we were good at the dentist's, my mother always bought us a swanboat ride. 
I circled the Public Garden -- over the bridge and under the blue-green monuments, past the American flag flowerbed and the entrance where you could have your picture taken in an orange-and-white striped canvas booth for twenty-five cents -- reading the names of the trees. 
My favorite tree was the Weeping Scholar Tree. I thought it must come from Japan. They understood things of the spirit in Japan. 
They disemboweled themselves when anything went wrong. 
I tried to imagine how they would go about it. They must have an extremely sharp knife. No, probably two extremely sharp knives. Then they would sit down, cross-legged, a knife in either hand. Then they would cross their hands and point a knife at each side of their stomach. They would have to be naked, or the knife would get stuck in their clothes. 
Then in one quick flash, before they had time to think twice, they would jab the knives in and zip them round, one on the upper crescent and one on the lower crescent, making a full circle. Then their stomach skin would come loose, like a plate, and their insides would fall out, and they would die. 
It must take a lot of courage to die like that. 
My trouble was I hated the sight of blood. 
I thought I might stay in the park all night. 
The next morning Dodo Conway was driving my mother and me to Walton, and if I was to run away before it was too late, now was the time. I looked in my pocketbook and counted out a dollar bill and seventy-nine cents in dunes and nickels and pennies. 
I had no idea how much it would cost to get to Chicago, and I didn't dare go to the bank and draw out all my money, because I thought Doctor Gordon might well have warned the bank clerk to intercept me if I made an obvious move. 
Hitchhiking occurred to me, but I had no idea which of all the routes out of Boston led to Chicago. It's easy enough to find directions on a map, but I had very little knowledge of directions when I was smack in the middle of somewhere. Every time I wanted to figure what was east or what was west it seemed to be noon, or cloudy, which was no help at all, or nighttime, and except for the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia's Chair, I was hopeless at stars, a failing which always disheartened Buddy Willard. 
I decided to walk to the bus terminal and inquire about the fares to Chicago. Then I might go to the bank and withdraw precisely that amount, which would not cause so much suspicion. 
I had just strolled in through the glass doors of the terminal and was browsing over the rack of colored tour leaflets and schedules, when I realized that the bank in my home town would be closed, as it was already mid-afternoon, and I couldn't get any money out till the next day. 
My appointment at Walton was for ten o'clock. 
At that moment, the loudspeaker crackled into life and started announcing the stops of a bus getting ready to leave in the parking lot outside. The voice on the loudspeaker went bockle bockle bockle, the way they do, so you can't understand a word, and then, in the middle of all the static, I heard a familiar name clear as A on the piano in the middle of all the tuning instruments of an orchestra. 
It was a stop two blocks from my house. 
I hurried out into the hot, dusty, end-of-July afternoon, sweating and sandy-mouthed, as if late for a difficult interview, and boarded the red bus, whose motor was already running. 
I handed my fare to the driver, and silently, on gloved hinges, the door folded shut at my back 

Twelve
 DOCTOR GORDON'S private hospital crowned a grassy rise at the end of a long, secluded drive that had been whitened with broken quahog shells. The yellow clapboard walls of the large house, with its encircling veranda, gleamed in the sun, but no people strolled on the green dome of the lawn. 
As my mother and I approached the summer heat bore down on us, and a cicada started up, like an aerial lawnmower, in the heart of a copper beech tree at the back. The sound of the cicada only served to underline the enormous silence. 
A nurse met us at the door. 
"Will you wait in the living room, please. Doctor Gordon will be with you presently." 
What bothered me was that everything about the house seemed normal, although I knew it must be chock-full of crazy people. There were no bars on the windows that I could see, and no wild or disquieting noises. Sunlight measured itself out in regular oblongs on the shabby, but soft red carpets, and a whiff of fresh-cut grass sweetened the air. 
I paused in the doorway of the living room. 
For a minute I thought it was the replica of a lounge in a guest house I visited once on an island off the coast of Maine. The French doors let in a dazzle of white light, a grand piano filled the far corner of the room, and people in summer clothes were sitting about at card tables and in the lopsided wicker armchairs one so often finds at down-at≠heel seaside resorts. 
Then I realized that none of the people were moving. 
I focused more closely, trying to pry some clue from their stiff postures. I made out men and women, and boys and girls who must be as young as I, but there was a uniformity to their faces, as if they had lain for a long time on the shelf, out of the sunlight, under siftings of pale, fine dust. 
Then I saw that some of the people were indeed moving, but with such small, birdlike gestures I had not at first discerned them. 
A gray-faced man was counting out a deck of cards, one, two, three, four. . . I thought he must be seeing if it was a full pack, but when he had finished counting, he started over again. Next to him, a fat lady played with a string of wooden beads. She drew all the beads up to one end of the string. Then click, click, click, she let them fall back on each other. 
At the piano, a young girl leafed through a few sheets of music, but when she saw me looking at her, she ducked her head crossly and tore the sheets in half. 
My mother touched my arm, and I followed her into the room. 
We sat, without speaking, on a lumpy sofa that creaked each time one stirred. 
Then my gaze slid over the people to the blaze of green beyond the diaphanous curtains, and I felt as if I were sitting in the window of an enormous department store. The figures around me weren't people, but shop dummies, painted to resemble people and propped up in attitudes counterfeiting life. 
I climbed after Doctor Gordon's dark-jacketed back. 
Downstairs, in the hall, I had tried to ask him what the shock treatment would be like, but when I opened my mouth no words came out, my eyes only widened and stared at the smiling, familiar face that floated before me like a plate full of assurances. 
At the top of the stairs, the garnet-colored carpet stopped. A plain, brown linoleum, tacked to the floor, took its place, and extended down a corridor lined with shut white doors. As I followed Doctor Gordon, a door opened somewhere in the distance, and I heard a woman shouting. 
All at once a nurse popped around the corner of the corridor ahead of us leading a woman in a blue bathrobe with shaggy, waist-length hair. Doctor Gordon stepped back, and I flattened against the wall 
As the woman was dragged by, waving her arms and struggling in the grip of the nurse, she was saying, "I'm going to jump out of the window, I'm going to jump out of the window, I'm going to jump out of the window." 
Dumpy and muscular in her smudge-fronted uniform, the wall-eyed nurse wore such thick spectacles that four eyes peered out at me from behind the round, twin panes of glass. I was trying to tell which eyes were the real eyes and which the false eyes, and which of the real eyes was the wall-eye and which the straight eye, when she brought her face up to mine with a large, conspiratorial grin and hissed, as if to reassure me, "She thinks she's going to jump out the window but she can't jump out the window because they're all barred!" 
And as Doctor Gordon led me into a bare room at the back of the house, I saw that the windows in that part were indeed barred, and that the room door and the closet door and the drawers of the bureau and everything that opened and shut was fitted with a keyhole so it could be locked up. 
I lay down on the bed. 
The wall-eyed nurse came back. She unclasped my watch and dropped it in her pocket. Then she started tweaking the hairpins from my hair. 
Doctor Gordon was unlocking the closet. He dragged out a table on wheels with a machine on it and rolled it behind the head of the bed. The nurse started swabbing my temples with a smelly grease. 
As she leaned over to reach the side of my head nearest the wall, her fat breast muffled my face like a cloud or a pillow. A vague, medicinal stench emanated from her flesh. 
"Don't worry," the nurse grinned down at me. "Their first time everybody's scared to death." 
I tried to smile, but my skin had gone stiff, like parchment. 
Doctor Gordon was fitting two metal plates on either side of my head. He buckled them into place with a strap that dented my forehead, and gave me a wire to bite. 
I shut my eyes. 
There was a brief silence, like an indrawn breath. 
Then something bent down and took hold of me and shook me like the end of the world. Whee-ee-ee-ee-ee, it shrilled, through an air crackling with blue light, and with each flash a great jolt drubbed me till I thought my bones would break and the sap fly out of me like a split plant. 
I wondered what terrible thing it was that I had done. 
I was sitting in a wicker chair, holding a small cocktail glass of tomato juice. The watch had been replaced on my wrist, but it looked odd. Then I realised it had been fastened upside down. I sensed the unfamiliar positioning of the hairpins in my hair. 
"How do you feel?" 
An old metal floor lamp surfaced in my mind. One of the few relics of my father's study, it was surmounted by a copper bell which held the light bulb, and from which a frayed, tiger-colored cord ran down the length of the metal stand to a socket in the wall. 
One day I decided to move this lamp from the side of my mother's bed to my desk at the other end of the room. The cord would be long enough, so I didn't unplug it. I closed both hands around the lamp and the fuzzy cord and gripped them tight 
Then something leapt out of the lamp in a blue flash and shook me till my teeth rattled, and I tried to pull my hands off, but they were stuck, and I screamed, or a scream was torn from my throat, for I didn't recognize it, but heard it soar and quaver in the air like a violently disembodied spirit. 
Then my hands jerked free, and I fell back onto my mother's bed. A small hole, blackened as if with pencil lead, pitted the center of my right palm. 
"How do you feel?"
 "All right." 
But I didn't. I felt terrible. 
"Which college did you say you went to?" 
I said what college it was. 
"Ah!" Doctor Gordon's face lighted with a slow, almost tropical smile. "They had a WAC station up there, didn't they, during the war?" 
My mother's knuckles were bone-white, as if the skin had worn off them in the hour of waiting. She looked past me to Doctor Gordon, and he must have nodded, or smiled, because her face relaxed. 
"A few more shock treatments, Mrs. Greenwood," I heard Doctor Gordon say, "and I think you'll notice a wonderful improvement." 
The girl was still sitting on the piano stool, the torn sheet of music splayed at her feet like a dead bird. She stared at me, and I stared back. Her eyes narrowed. She stuck out her tongue. 
My mother was following Doctor Gordon to the door. I lingered behind, and when their backs were turned, I rounded on the girl and thumbed both ears at her. She pulled her tongue in, and her face went stony. 
I walked out into the sun. 
Pantherlike in a dapple of tree shadow, Dodo Conway's black station wagon lay in wait. 
The station wagon had been ordered originally by a wealthy society lady, black, without a speck of chrome, and with black leather upholstery, but when it came, it depressed her. It was the dead spit of a hearse, she said, and everybody else thought so too, and nobody would buy it, so the Conways drove it home, cut-price, and saved themselves a couple of hundred dollars. 
Sitting in the front seat, between Dodo and my mother, I felt dumb and subdued. Every time I tried to concentrate, my mind glided off, like a skater, into a large empty space, and pirouetted there, absently. 
"I'm through with that Doctor Gordon," I said, after we had left Dodo and her black station wagon behind the pines. "You can call him up and tell him I'm not coming next week." 
My mother smiled. "I knew my baby wasn't like that." 
I looked at her. "Like what?" 
"Like those awful people. Those awful dead people at that hospital." She paused. "I knew you'd decide to be all right again." 
STARLET SUCCUMBS AFTER 68-HOUR COMA. 
I felt in my pocketbook among the paper scraps and the compact and the peanut shells and the dimes and nickels and the blue jiffy box containing nineteen Gillette blades, till I unearthed the snapshot I'd had taken that afternoon in the orange-and-white striped booth. 
I brought it up next to the smudgy photograph of the dead girl. It matched, mouth for mouth, nose for nose. The only difference was the eyes. The eyes in the snapshot were open, and those in the newspaper photograph were closed. But I knew if the dead girl's eyes were to be thumbed wide, they would look at me with the same dead, black, vacant expression as the eyes in the snapshot. 
I stuffed the snapshot back in my pocketbook. 
"I will just sit here in the sun on this park bench five minutes more by the clock on that building over there," I told myself, "and then I will go somewhere and do it." 
I summoned my little chorus of voices. 
Doesn't your work interest you, Esther? 
You know, Esther, you've got the perfect setup of a true neurotic. 
You'll never get anywhere like that, you'll never get anywhere like that, you'll never get anywhere like that. 
Once on a hot summer night, I had spent an hour kissing a hairy, ape-shaped law student from Yale because I felt sorry for him, he was so ugly. When I had finished, he said, "I have you typed, baby. You'll be a prude at forty." 
"Factitious!" my creative writing professor at college scrawled on a story of mine called "The Big Weekend." 
I hadn't known what factitious meant, so I looked it up in the dictionary. 
 Factitious, artificial, sham. 
You'll never get anywhere like that. 
I hadn't slept for twenty-one nights. 
I thought the most beautiful thing in the world must be shadow, the million moving shapes and cul-de-sacs of shadow. There was shadow in bureau drawers and closets and suitcases, and shadow under houses and trees and stones, and shadow at the back of people's eyes and smiles, and shadow, miles and miles and miles of it, on the night side of the earth. 
I looked down at the two flesh-colored Band-Aids forming a cross on the calf of my right leg. 
That morning I had made a start. 
I had locked myself in the bathroom, and run a tub full of warm water, and taken out a Gillette blade. 
When they asked some old Roman philosopher or other how he wanted to die, he said he would open his veins in a warm bath. I thought it would be easy, lying in the tub and seeing the redness flower from my wrists, flush after flush through the clear water, till I sank to sleep under a surf gaudy as poppies. 
But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrist looked so white and defenseless that I couldn't do it. It was as if what I wanted to kill wasn't in that skin or the thin blue pulse that jumped under my thumb, but somewhere else, deeper, more secret, a whole lot harder to get at. 
It would take two motions. One wrist, then the other wrist. Three motions, if you counted changing the razor from hand to hand. Then I would step into the tub and lie down. 
I moved in front of the medicine cabinet. If I looked in the mirror while I did it, it would be like watching somebody else, in a book or a play. 
But the person in the mirror was paralyzed and too stupid to do a thing. 
Then I thought maybe I ought to spill a little blood for practice, so I sat on the edge of the tub and crossed my right ankle over my left knee. Then I lifted my right hand with the razor and let it drop of its own weight, like a guillotine, onto the calf of my leg. 
I felt nothing. Then I felt a small, deep thrill, and a bright seam of red welled up at the lip of the slash. The blood gathered darkly, like fruit, and rolled down my ankle into the cup of my black patent leather shoe. 
I thought of getting into the tub then, but I realized my dallying had used up the better part of the morning, and that my mother would probably come home and find me before I was done. 
So I bandaged the cut, packed up my Gillette blades and caught the eleven-thirty bus to Boston. 
"Sorry, baby, there's no subway to the Deer Island Prison, it's on a niland." 
"No, it's not on an island, it used to be on an island, but they filled up the water with dirt and now it joins on to the mainland." 
"There's no subway." 
"I've got to get there." 
"Hey," the fat man in the ticket booth peered at me through the grating, "don't cry. Who you got there, honey, some relative?" 
People shoved and bumped by me in the artificially lit dark, hurrying after the trains that rumbled in and out of the intestinal tunnels under Scollay Square. I could feel the tears start to spurt from the screwed-up nozzles of my eyes. 
 "It's my father." 
The fat man consulted a diagram on the wall of his booth. "Here's how you do," he said, "you take a car from that track over there and get off at Orient Heights and then hop a bus with The Point on it." He beamed at me. "It'll run you straight to the prison gate." 
"Hey you!" A young fellow in a blue uniform waved from the hut. 
I waved back and kept on going. 
 "Hey you!" 
I stopped and walked slowly over to the hut that perched like a circular living room on the waste of sands. 
"Hey, you can't go any further. That's prison property, no trespassers allowed." 
"I thought you could go anyplace along the beach," I said. "So long as you stayed under the tideline." 
The fellow thought a minute. 
Then he said, "Not this beach." 
He had a pleasant, fresh face. 
"You've a nice place here," I said. "It's like a little house." 
He glanced back into the room, with its braided rug and chintz curtains. He smiled. 
"We even got a coffee pot," 
"I used to live near here." 
"No kidding. I was born and brought up in this town myself." 
I looked across the sands to the parking lot and the barred gate, and past the barred gate to the narrow road, lapped by the ocean on both sides, that led out to the one≠time island. 
The red brick buildings of the prison looked friendly, like the buildings of a seaside college. On a green hump of lawn to the left, I could see small white spots and slightly larger pink spots moving about. I asked the guard what they were, and he said, "Them's pigs 'n' chickens." 
I was thinking that if I'd had the sense to go on living in that old town I might just have met this prison guard in school and married him and had a parcel of little kids by now. It would be nice, living by the sea with piles of little kids and pigs and chickens, wearing what my grandmother called wash dresses, and sitting about in some kitchen with bright linoleum and fat arms, drinking pots of coffee. 
"How do you get into that prison?" 
"You get a pass." 
"No, how do you get locked in?" 
"Oh," the guard laughed, "you steal a car, you rob a store." 
"You got any murderers in there?" 
"No. Murderers go to a big state place." 
"Who else is in there?" 
"Well, the first day of winter we get these old bums out of Boston. They heave a brick through a window, and then they get picked up and spend the winter out of the cold, with TV and plenty to eat, and basketball games on the weekend." 
 "That's nice." 
"Nice if you like it," said the guard. 
I said good-bye and started to move off, glancing back over my shoulder only once. The guard still stood in the doorway of his observation booth, and when I turned he lifted his arm in a salute. 
The log I sat on was lead-heavy and smelled of tar. Under the stout, gray cylinder of the water tower on its commanding hill, the sandbar curved out into the sea. At high tide the bar completely submerged itself. 
I remembered that sandbar well. It harbored, in the crook of its inner curve, a particular shell that could be found nowhere else on the beach. 
The shell was thick, smooth, big as a thumb joint, and usually white, although sometimes pink or peach-colored. It resembled a sort of modest conch. 
"Mummy, that girl's still sitting there." 
I looked up, idly, and saw a small, sandy child being dragged up from the sea's edge by a skinny, bird-eyed woman in red shorts and a red-and-white polka-dot halter. 
I hadn't counted on the beach being overrun with summer people. In the ten years of my absence, fancy blue and pink and pale green shanties had sprung up on the flat sands of the Point like a crop of tasteless mushrooms, and the silver airplanes and cigar-shaped blimps had given way to jets that scoured the rooftops in their loud offrush from the airport across the bay. 
I was the only girl on the beach in a skirt and high heels, and it occurred to me I must stand out. I had removed my patent leather shoes after a while, for they foundered badly in the sand. It pleased me to think they would be perched there on the silver log, pointing out to sea, like a sort of soul-compass, after I was dead. 
I fingered the box of razors in my pocketbook. 
Then I thought how stupid I was. I had the razors, but no warm bath. 
I considered renting a room. There must be a boarding-house among all those summer places. But I had no luggage. That would create suspicion. Besides, in a boardinghouse other people are always wanting to use the bathroom. I'd hardly have time to do it and step into the tub when somebody would be pounding at the door. 
The gulls on their wooden stilts at the tip of the bar miaowed like cats. Then they flapped up, one by one, in their ash-colored jackets, circling my head and crying. 
"Say, lady, you better not sit out here, the tide's coming in." 
The small boy squatted a few feet away. He picked up a round purple stone and lobbed it into the water. The water swallowed it with a resonant plop. Then he scrabbled around, and I heard the dry stones clank together like money. 
He skimmed a flat stone over the dull green surface, and it skipped seven times before it sliced out of sight. 
"Why don't you go home?" I said. 
The boy skipped another, heavier stone. It sank after the second bounce. 
"Don't want to." 
"Your mother's looking for you." 
"She is not." He sounded worried. 
"If you go home, I'll give you some candy." 
The boy hitched closer. "What kind?" 
But I knew without looking into my pocketbook that all I had was peanut shells. 
"I'll give you some money to buy some candy." 
"Ar-thur!" 
A woman was indeed coming out on the sandbar, slipping and no doubt cursing to herself, for her lips went up and down between her clear, peremptory calls. 
"Ar-thur!" 
She shaded her eyes with one hand, as if this helped her discern us through the thickening sea dusk. 
I could sense the boy's interest dwindle as the pull of his mother increased. He began to pretend he didn't know me. He kicked over a few stones, as if searching for something, and edged off. 
 I shivered. 
The stones lay lumpish and cold under my bare feet. I thought longingly of the black shoes on the beach. A wave drew back, like a hand, then advanced and touched my foot. 
The drench seemed to come off the sea floor itself, where blind white fish ferried themselves by their own light through the great polar cold. I saw sharks' teeth and whales' earbones littered about down there like gravestones. 
I waited, as if the sea could make my decision for me. 
A second wave collapsed over my feet, lipped with white froth, and the chill gripped my ankles with a mortal ache. 
My flesh winced, in cowardice, from such a death. 
I picked up my pocketbook and started back over the cold stones to where my shoes kept their vigil in the violet light. 

Thirteen 
"Of course his mother killed him." 
I looked at the mouth of the boy Jody had wanted me to meet. His lips were thick and pink and a baby face nestled under the silk of white-blond hair. His name was Cal, which I thought must be short for something, but I couldn't think what it would be short for, unless it was California. 
"How can you be sure she killed him?" I said. 
Cal was supposed to be very intelligent, and Jody had said over the phone that he was cute and I would like him. I wondered, if I'd been my old self, if I would have liked him. 
It was impossible to tell. 
"Well, first she says No no no, and then she says Yes." 
"But then she says No no again." 
Cal and I lay side by side on an orange-and-green striped towel on a mucky beach across the swamps from Lynn. Jody and Mark, the boy she was pinned to, were swimming. Cal hadn't wanted to swim, he had wanted to talk, and we were arguing about this play where a young man finds out he has a brain disease, on account of his father fooling around with unclean women, and in the end his brain, which has been softening all along, snaps completely, and his mother is debating whether to kill him or not. 
I had a suspicion that my mother had called Jody and begged her to ask me out, so I wouldn't sit around in my room all day with the shades drawn. I didn't want to go at first, because I thought Jody would notice the change in me, and that anybody with half an eye would see I didn't have a brain in my head. 
But all during the drive north, and then east, Jody had joked and laughed and chattered and not seemed to mind that I only said, "My" or "Gosh" or "You don't say." 
We browned hot dogs on the public grills at the beach, and by watching Jody and Mark and Cal very carefully I managed to cook my hot dog just the right amount of time and didn't burn it or drop it into the fire, the way I was afraid of doing. Then, when nobody was looking, I buried it in the sand. 
After we ate, Jody and Mark ran down to the water hand-in-hand, and I lay back, staring into the sky, while Cal went on and on about this play. 
The only reason I remembered this play was because it had a mad person in it, and everything I had ever read about mad people stuck in my mind, while everything else flew out. 
"But it's the Yes that matters," Cal said. "It's the Yes she'll come back to in the end." 
I lifted my head and squinted out at the bright blue plate of the sea -- a bright blue plate with a dirty rim. A big round gray rock, like the upper half of an egg, poked out of the water about a mile from the stony headland. 
"What was she going to kill him with? I forget." 
I hadn't forgotten. I remembered perfectly well, but I wanted to hear what Cal would say. 
 "Morphia powders." 
"Do you suppose they have morphia powders in America?" 
Cal considered a minute. Then he said, "I wouldn't think so. They sound awfully old-fashioned." 
I rolled over onto my stomach and squinted at the view in the other direction, toward Lynn. A glassy haze rippled up from the fires in the grills and the heat on the road, and through the haze, as through a curtain of clear water, I could make out a smudgy skyline of gas tanks and factory stacks and derricks and bridges. 
It looked one hell of a mess. 
I rolled onto my back again and made my voice casual. "If you were going to kill yourself, how would you do it?" 
Cal seemed pleased. "I've often thought of that. I'd blow my brains out with a gun." 
I was disappointed. It was just like a man to do it with a gun. A fat chance I had of laying my hands on a gun. And even if I did, I wouldn't have a clue as to what part of me to shoot at. 
I'd already read in the papers about people who'd tried to shoot themselves, only they ended up shooting an important nerve and getting paralyzed or blasting their face off, but being saved, by surgeons and a sort of miracle, from dying outright. 
The risks of a gun seemed great. "What kind of a gun?" 
"My father's shotgun. He keeps it loaded. I'd just have to walk into his study one day and," Cal pointed a finger to his temple and made a comical, screwed-up face, "click!" He widened his pale gray eyes and looked at me. 
"Does your father happen to live near Boston?" I asked idly. 
"Nope, in Clacton-on-Sea. He's English."  
Jody and Mark ran up hand-in-hand, dripping and shaking off water drops like two loving puppies. I thought there would be too many people, so I stood up and pretended to yawn. "I guess I'll go for a swim." 
Being with Jody and Mark and Cal was beginning to weigh on my nerves, like a dull wooden block on the strings of a piano. I was afraid that at any moment my control would snap, and I would start babbling about how I couldn't read and couldn't write and how I must be just about the only person who had stayed awake for a solid month without dropping dead of exhaustion, 
A smoke seemed to be going up from my nerves like the smoke from the grills and the sun-saturated road. The whole kndscape-beach and headland and sea and rock-quavered in front of my eyes like a stage backcloth. 
I wondered at what point in space the silly, sham blue of the sky turned black.  
"You swim too, Cal."  
Jody gave Cal a playful little push. 
"Ohhh." Cal hid his face in the towel. "It's too cold."  
I started to walk toward the water. 
Somehow, in the broad, shadowless light of noon, the water looked amiable and welcoming. 
I thought drowning must be the kindest way to die, and burning the worst. Some of those babies in the jars that Buddy Willard showed me had gills, he said. They went through a stage where they were just like fish. 
A little, rubbishy wavelet, full of candy wrappers and orange peel and seaweed, folded over my foot. 
I heard the sand thud behind me, and Cal came up. 
"Let's swim to that rock out there." I pointed at it 
"Are you crazy? That's a mile out." 
"What are you?" I said. "Chicken?" 
Cal took me by the elbow and jostled me into the water. When we were waist high, he pushed me under. I surfaced, splashing, my eyes seared with salt. Underneath, the water was green and semi-opaque as a hunk of quartz. 
I started to swim, a modified dogpaddle, keeping my face toward the rock. Cal did a slow crawl. After a while he put his head up and treaded water. 
"Can't make it." He was panting heavily. 
"Okay. You go back." 
I thought I would swim out until I was too tired to swim back. As I paddled on, my heartbeat boomed like a dull motor in my ears. 
I am I am I am. 
That morning I had tried to hang myself. 
I had taken the silk cord of my mother's yellow bathrobe as soon as she left for work, and, in the amber shade of the bedroom, fashioned it into a knot that slipped up and down on itself. It took me a long time to do this, because I was poor at knots and had no idea how to make a proper one. 
Then I hunted around for a place to attach the rope. 
The trouble was, our house had the wrong kind of ceilings. The ceilings were low, white and smoothly plastered, without a light fixture or a wood beam in sight. I thought with longing of the house my grandmother had before she sold it to come and live with us, and then with my Aunt Libby. 
My grandmother's house was built in the fine, nineteenth-century style, with lofty rooms and sturdy chandelier brackets and high closets with stout rails across them, and an attic where nobody ever went, full of trunks and parrot cages and dressmakers' dummies and overhead beams thick as a ship's timbers. 
But it was an old house, and she'd sold it, and I didn't know anybody else with a house like that. 
After a discouraging time of walking about with the silk cord dangling from my neck like a yellow cat's tail and finding no place to fasten it, I sat on the edge of my mother's bed and tried pulling the cord tight. 
But each time I would get the cord so tight I could feel a rushing in my ears and a flush of blood in my face, my hands would weaken and let go, and I would be all right again. 
Then I saw that my body had all sorts of little tricks, such as making my hands go limp at the crucial second, which would save it, time and again, whereas if I had the whole say, I would be dead in a flash. 
I would simply have to ambush it with whatever sense I had left, or it would trap me in its stupid cage for fifty years without any sense at all. And when people found out my mind had gone, as they would have to, sooner or later, in spite of my mother's guarded tongue, they would persuade her to put me into an asylum where I could be cured. 
Only my case was incurable. 
I had bought a few paperbacks on abnormal psychology at the drugstore and compared my symptoms with the symptoms in the books, and sure enough, my symptoms tallied with the most hopeless cases. 
The only thing I could read, besides the scandal sheets, were those abnormal-psychology books. It was as if some slim opening had been left, so I could learn all I needed to know about my case to end it in the proper way. 
I wondered, after the hanging fiasco, if I shouldn't just give it up and turn myself over to the doctors, and then I remembered Doctor Gordon and his private shock machine. Once I was locked up they could use that on me all the time. 
And I thought of how my mother and brother and friends would visit me, day after day, hoping I would be better. Then their visits would slacken off, and they would give up hope. They would grow old. They would forget me. 
They would be poor, too. 
They would want me to have the best of care at first, so they would sink all their money in a private hospital like Doctor Gordon's. Finally, when the money was used up, I would be moved to a state hospital, with hundreds of people like me, in a big cage in the basement. 
The more hopeless you were, the further away they hid you. 
Cal had turned around and was swimming in. 
As I watched, he dragged himself slowly out of the neck-deep sea. Against the khaki-colored sand and the green shore wavelets, his body was bisected for a moment, like a white worm. Then it crawled completely out of the green and onto the khaki and lost itself among dozens and dozens of other worms that were wriggling or just lolling about between the sea and the sky. 
I paddled my hands in the water and kicked my feet. The egg-shaped rock didn't seem to be any nearer than it had been when Cal and I had looked at it from the shore. 
Then I saw it would be pointless to swim as far as the rock, because my body would take that excuse to climb out and lie in the sun, gathering strength to swim back. 
The only thing to do was to drown myself then and there. 
So I stopped. 
I brought my hands to my breast, ducked my head, and dived, using my hands to push the water aside. The water pressed in on my eardrums and on my heart. I fanned myself down, but before I knew where I was, the water had spat me up into the sun, the world was sparkling all about me like blue and green and yellow semi-precious stones. 
I dashed the water from my eyes. 
I was panting, as after a strenuous exertion, but floating, without effort. 
I dived, and dived again, and each time popped up like a cork. 
The gray rock mocked me, bobbing on the water easy as a lifebuoy. 
I knew when I was beaten. 
I turned back. 
The flowers nodded like bright, knowledgeable children as I trundled them down the hall. 
I felt silly in my sage-green volunteer's uniform, and superfluous, unlike the white-uniformed doctors and nurses, ot even the brown-uniformed scrubwomen with their mops and their buckets of grimy water, who passed me without a word. 
If I had been getting paid, no matter how little, I could at least count this a proper job, but all I got for a morning of pushing round magazines and candy and flowers was a free lunch. 
My mother said the cure for thinking too much about yourself was helping somebody who was worse off than you, so Teresa had arranged for me to sign on as a volunteer at our local hospital. It was difficult to be a volunteer at this hospital, because that's what all the Junior League women wanted to do, but luckily for me, a lot of them were away on vacation. I had hoped they would send me to a ward with some really gruesome cases, who would see through my numb, dumb face to how I meant well, and be grateful. But the head of the volunteers, a society lady at our church, took one look at me and said, "You're on maternity." 
So I rode the elevator up three flights to the maternity ward and reported to the head nurse. She gave me the trolley of flowers. I was supposed to put the right vases at the right beds in the right rooms. 
But before I came to the door of the first room I noticed that a lot of the flowers were droopy and brown at the edges. I thought it would be discouraging for a woman who'd just had a baby to see somebody plonk down a big bouquet of dead flowers in front of her, so I steered the trolley to a washbasin in an alcove in the hall and began to pick out all the flowers that were dead. 
Then I picked out all those that were dying. 
There was no wastebasket in sight, so I crumpled the flowers up and laid them in the deep white basin. The basin felt cold as a tomb. I smiled. This must be how they laid the bodies away in the hospital morgue. My gesture, in its small way, echoed the larger gesture of the doctors and nurses. 
I swung the door of the first room open and walked in, dragging my trolley. A couple of nurses jumped up, and I had a confused impression of shelves and medicine cabinets. 
"What do you want?" one of the nurses demanded sternly. I couldn't tell one from the other, they all looked just alike. 
"I'm taking the flowers round." 
The nurse who had spoken put a hand on my shoulder and led me out of the room, maneuvering the trolley with her free, expert hand. She flung open the swinging doors of the room next to that one and bowed me in. Then she disappeared. 
I could hear giggles in the distance till a door shut and cut them off. 
There were six beds in the room, and each bed had a woman in it. The women were all sitting up and knitting or riffling through magazines or putting their hair in pin curls and chattering like parrots in a parrot house. 
I had thought they would be sleeping, or lying quiet and pale, so I could tiptoe round without any trouble and match the bed numbers to the numbers inked on adhesive tape on the vases, but before I had a chance to get my bearings, a bright, jazzy blonde with a sharp, triangular face beckoned to me. 
I approached her, leaving the trolley in the middle of the floor, but then she made an impatient gesture, and I saw she wanted me to bring the trolley too. 
I wheeled the trolley over to her bedside with a helpful smile. 
"Hey, where's my larkspur?" A large, flabby lady from across the ward raked me with an eagle eye. 
The sharp-faced blonde bent over the trolley. "Here are my yellow roses," she said, "but they're all mixed up with some lousy iris." 
Other voices joined the voices of the first two women. They sounded cross and loud and full of complaint. 
I was opening my mouth to explain that I had thrown a bunch of dead larkspur in the sink, and that some of the vases I had weeded out looked skimpy, there were so few flowers left, so I had joined a few of the bouquets together to fill them out, when the swinging door flew open and a nurse stalked in to see what the commotion was. 
"Listen, nurse, I had this big bunch of larkspur Larry brought last night." 
"She's loused up my yellow roses." 
Unbuttoning the green uniform as I ran, I stuffed it, in passing, into the washbasin with the rubbish of dead flowers. Then I took the deserted side steps down to the street two at a time, without meeting another soul 
"Which way is the graveyard?" 
The Italian in the black leather jacket stopped and pointed down an alley behind the white Methodist church. I remembered the Methodist church. I had been a Methodist for the first nine years of my life, before my father died and we moved and turned Unitarian. 
My mother had been a Catholic before she was a Methodist. My grandmother and my grandfather and my Aunt Libby were all still Catholics. My Aunt Libby had broken away from the Catholic Church at the same time my mother did, but then she'd fallen in love with an Italian Catholic, so she'd gone back again. 
Lately I had considered going into the Catholic Church myself. I knew the Catholics thought killing yourself was an awful sin. But perhaps, if this was so, they might have a good way to persuade me out of it 
Of course, I didn't believe in life after death or the virgin birth or the Inquisition or the infallibility of that little monkey-faced Pope or anything, but I didn't have to let the priest see this, I could just concentrate on my sin, and he would help me repent. 
The only trouble was, Church, even the Catholic Church, didn't take up the whole of your life. No matter how much you knelt and prayed, you still had to eat three meals a day and have a job and live in the world. 
I thought I might see how long you had to be a Catholic before you became a nun, so I asked my mother, thinking she'd know the best way to go about it. 
My mother had laughed at me. "Do you think they'll take somebody like you, right off the bat? Why you've got to know all these catechisms and credos and believe in them, lock, stock and barrel. A girl with your sense!" 
Still, I imagined myself going to some Boston priest -- it would have to be Boston, because I didn't want any priest in my home town to know I'd thought of killing myself. Priests were terrible gossips. 
I would be in black, with my dead white face, and I would throw myself at this priest's feet and say, "O Father, help me." 
But that was before people had begun to look at me in a funny way, like those nurses in the hospital. 
I was pretty sure the Catholics wouldn't take in any crazy nuns. My Aunt Libby's husband had made a joke once, about a nun that a nunnery sent to Teresa for a checkup. This nun kept hearing harp notes in her ears and a voice saying over and over, "Alleluia!" Only she wasn't sure, on being closely questioned, whether the voice was saying Alleluia or Arizona. The nun had been born in Arizona. I think she ended up in some asylum. 
I tugged my black veil down to my chin and strode in through the wrought-iron gates. I thought it odd that in all the time my father had been buried in this graveyard, none of us had ever visited him. My mother hadn't let us come to his funeral because we were only children then, and he had died in the hospital, so the graveyard and even his death had always seemed unreal to me. 
I had a great yearning, lately, to pay my father back for all the years of neglect, and start tending his grave. I had always been my father's favorite, and it seemed fitting I should take on a mourning my mother had never bothered with. 
I thought that if my father hadn't died, he would have taught me all about insects, which was his specialty at the university. He would also have taught me German and Greek and Latin, which he knew, and perhaps I would be a Lutheran. My father had been a Lutheran in Wisconsin, but they were out of style in New England, so he had become a lapsed Lutheran and then, my mother said, a bitter atheist. 
The graveyard disappointed me. It lay at the outskirts of the town, on low ground, like a rubbish dump, and as I walked up and down the gravel paths, I could smell the stagnant salt marshes in the distance. 
The old part of the graveyard was all right, with its worn, flat stones and lichen-bitten monuments, but I soon saw my father must be buried in the modern part with dates in the nineteen forties. 
The stones in the modern part were crude and cheap, and here and there a grave was rimmed with marble, like an oblong bathtub full of dirt, and rusty metal containers stuck up about where the person's navel would be, full of plastic flowers. A fine drizzle started drifting down from the gray sky, and I grew very depressed. 
I couldn't find my father anywhere. 
Low, shaggy clouds scudded over that part of the horizon where the sea lay, behind the marshes and the beach shanty settlements, and raindrops darkened the black mackintosh I had bought that morning. A clammy dampness sank through to my skin. 
I had asked the salesgirl, "Is it water-repellent?" And she had said, "No raincoat is ever water-repellent. It's showerproofed." 
And when I asked her what showerproofed was, she told me I had better buy an umbrella. 
But I hadn't enough money for an umbrella. What with bus fare in and out of Boston and peanuts and newspapers and abnormal-psychology books and trips to my old home town by the sea, my New York fund was almost exhausted. 
I had decided that when there was no more money in my bank account I would do it, and that morning I'd spent the last of it on the black raincoat.  
Then I saw my father's gravestone. 
It was crowded right up by another gravestone, head to head, the way people are crowded in a charity ward when there isn't enough space. The stone was of a mottled pink marble, like canned salmon, and all there was on it was my father's name and, under it, two dates, separated by a little dash.  
At the foot of the stone I arranged the rainy armful of azaleas I had picked from a bush at the gateway of the graveyard. Then my legs folded under me, and I sat down in the sopping grass. I couldn't understand why I was crying so hard. 
Then I remembered that I had never cried for my father's death. 
My mother hadn't cried either. She had just smiled and said what a merciful thing it was for him he had died, because if he had lived he would have been crippled and an invalid for life, and he couldn't have stood that, he would rather have died than had that happen. 
I laid my face to the smooth face of the marble and howled my loss into the cold salt rain. 
I knew just how to go about it 
The minute the car tires crunched off down the drive and the sound of the motor faded, I jumped out of bed and hurried into my white blouse and green figured skirt and black raincoat. The raincoat felt damp still, from the day before, but that would soon cease to matter. 
I went downstairs and picked up a pale blue envelope from the dining room table and scrawled on the back, in large, painstaking letters: I am going for a long walk. 
I propped the message where my mother would see it the minute she came in. 
Then I laughed. 
I had forgotten the most Important thing. 
I ran upstairs and dragged a chair into my mother's closet. Then I climbed up and reached for the small green strongbox on the top shelf. I could have torn the metal cover off with my bare hands, the lock was so feeble, but I wanted to do things in a calm, orderly way. 
I pulled out my mother's upper right-hand bureau drawer and slipped the blue jewelry box from its hiding place under the scented Irish linen handkerchiefs. I unpinned the little key from the dark velvet. Then I unlocked the strongbox and took out the bottle of new pills. There were more than I had hoped. 
There were at least fifty. 
If I had waited until my mother doled them out to me, night by night, it would have taken me fifty nights to save up enough. And in fifty nights, college would have opened, and my brother would have come back from Germany, and it would be too late. 
I pinned the key back in the jewelry box among the clutter of inexpensive chains and rings, put the jewelry box back in the drawer under the handkerchiefs, returned the strongbox to the closet shelf and set the chair on the rug in the exact spot I had dragged it from. 
Then I went downstairs and into the kitchen. I turned on the tap and poured myself a tall glass of water. Then I took the glass of water and the bottle of pills and went down into the cellar. 
A dim, undersea light filtered through the slits of the cellar windows. Behind the oil burner, a dark gap showed in the wall at about shoulder height and ran back under the breezeway, out of sight. The breezeway had been added to the house after the cellar was dug, and built out over this secret, earth-bottomed crevice. 
A few old, rotting fireplace logs blocked the hole mouth. I shoved them back a bit. Then I set the glass of water and the bottle of pills side by side on the flat surface of one of the logs and started to heave myself up. 
It took me a good while to heft my body into the gap, but at last, after many tries, I managed it, and crouched at the mouth of the darkness, like a troll. 
The earth seemed friendly under my bare feet, but cold. I wondered how long it had been since this particular square of soil had seen the sun. 
Then, one after the other, I lugged the heavy, dust-covered logs across the hole mouth. The dark felt thick as velvet. I reached for the glass and bottle, and carefully, on my knees, with bent head, crawled to the farthest wall 
Cobwebs touched my face with the softness of moths. Wrapping my black coat round me like my own sweet shadow, I unscrewed the bottle of pills and started taking them swiftly, between gulps of water, one by one by one. 
At first nothing happened, but as I approached the bottom of the bottle, red and blue lights began to flash before my eyes. The bottle slid from my fingers and I lay down. 
The silence drew off, baring the pebbles and shells and all the tatty wreckage of my life. Then, at the rim of vision, it gathered itself, and in one sweeping tide, rushed me to sleep. 

Fourteen 
It was completely dark. 
I felt the darkness, but nothing else, and my head rose, feeling it, like the head of a worm. Someone was moaning. Then a great, hard weight smashed against my cheek like a stone wall and the moaning stopped. 
The silence surged back, smoothing itself as black water smooths to its old surface calm over a dropped stone. 
A cool wind rushed by. I was being transported at enormous speed down a tunnel into the earth. Then the wind stopped. There was a rumbling, as of many voices, protesting and disagreeing in the distance. Then the voices stopped. 
A chisel cracked down on my eye, and a slit of light opened, like a mouth or a wound, till the darkness clamped shut on it again. I tried to roll away from the direction of the light, but hands wrapped round my limbs like mummy bands, and I couldn't move. 
I began to think I must be in an underground chamber, lit by blinding lights, and that the chamber was full of people who for some reason were holding me down. 
Then the chisel struck again, and the light leapt into my head, and through the thick, warm, furry dark, a voice cried, 
"Mother!" 
Air breathed and played over my face. 
I felt the shape of a room around me, a big room with open windows. A pillow molded itself under my head, and my body floated, without pressure, between thin sheets. 
Then I felt warmth, like a hand on my face. I must be lying in the sun. If I opened my eyes, I would see colors and shapes bending in upon me like nurses. 
I opened my eyes. 
It was completely dark. 
Somebody was breathing beside me. 
"I can't see," I said. 
A cheery voice spoke out of the dark. "There are lots of blind people in the world. You'll marry a nice blind man someday." 
The man with the chisel had come back. 
"Why do you bother?" I said. "It's no use." 
"You musn't talk like that." His fingers probed at the great, aching boss over my left eye. Then he loosened something, and a ragged gap of light appeared, like the hole in a wall. A man's hand peered round the edge of it. 
"Can you see me?"
 "Yes." 
"Can you see anything else?" 
Then I remembered. "I can't see anything." The gap narrowed and went dark. "I'm blind." 
"Nonsense! Who told you that?" 
 "The nurse." 
The man snorted. He finished taping the bandage back over my eye. "You are a very lucky girl Your sight is perfectly intact." 
"Somebody to see you." 
The nurse beamed and disappeared. 
My mother came smiling round the foot of the bed. She was wearing a dress with purple cartwheels on it and she looked awful. 
A big tall boy followed her. At first I couldn't make out who it was, because my eye only opened a short way, but then I saw it was my brother. 
"They said you wanted to see me." 
My mother perched on the edge of the bed and laid a hand on my leg. She looked loving and reproachful, and I wanted her to go away. 
"I didn't think I said anything." 
"They said you called for me." She seemed ready to cry. Her face puckered up and quivered like a pale jelly. 
"How are you?" my brother said.  
I looked my mother in the eye.  
"The same," I said. 
"You have a visitor." 
"I don't want a visitor." 
The nurse bustled out and whispered to somebody In the hall. Then she came back. "He'd very much like to see you." 
I looked down at the yellow legs sticking out of the unfamiliar white silk pajamas they had dressed me in. The skin shook flabbily when I moved, as if there wasn't a muscle in it, and it was covered with a short, thick stubble of black hair.  
"Who is it?" 
"Somebody you know."  
"What's his name?" 
"George Bakewell." 
"I don't know any George Bakewell."  
"He says he knows you." 
Then the nurse went out, and a very familiar boy came in and said, "Mind if I sit on the edge of your bed?" 
He was wearing a white coat, and I could see a stethoscope poking out of his pocket. I thought it must be somebody I knew dressed up as a doctor. 
I had meant to cover my legs if anybody came in, but now I saw it was too late, so I let them stick out, just as they were, disgusting and ugly. 
"That's me," I thought. "That's what I am."  
"You remember me, don't you, Esther?" I squinted at the boy's face through the crack of my good eye. The other eye hadn't opened yet, but the eye doctor said it would be all right in a few days. 
The boy looked at me as if I were some exciting new zoo animal and he was about to burst out laughing. 
"You remember me, don't you, Esther?" He spoke slowly, the way one speaks to a dull child. "I'm George Bakewell. I go to your church. You dated my roommate once at Amherst." 
I thought I placed the boy's face then. It hovered dimly at the rim of memory -- the sort of face to which I would never bother to attach a name. 
"What are you doing here?" 
"I'm houseman at this hospital." 
How could this George Bakewell have become a doctor so suddenly? I wondered. He didn't really know me, either. He just wanted to see what a girl who was crazy enough to kill herself looked like. 
I turned my face to the wall. 
"Get out," I said. "Get the hell out and don't come back." 
"I want to see a mirror." 
The nurse hummed busily as she opened one drawer after another, stuffing the new underclothes and blouses and skirts and pajamas my mother had bought me into the black patent leather overnight case. 
"Why can't I see a mirror?" 
I had been dressed in a sheath, striped gray and white, like mattress ticking, with a wide, shiny red belt, and they had propped me up in an armchair. 
"Why can't I?" 
"Because you better not." The nurse shut the lid of the overnight case with a little snap. 
 "Why?" 
"Because you don't look very pretty." 
"Oh, just let me see." 
The nurse sighed and opened the top bureau drawer. She took out a large mirror in a wooden frame that matched the wood of the bureau and handed it to me. 
At first I didn't see what the trouble was. It wasn't a mirror at all, but a picture. 
You couldn't tell whether the person in the picture was a man or a woman, because their hair was shaved off and sprouted in bristly chicken-feather tufts all over their head. One side of the person's face was purple, and bulged out in a shapeless way, shading to green along the edges, and then to a sallow yellow. The person's mouth was pale brown, with a rose-colored sore at either corner. 
The most startling thing about the face was its supernatural conglomeration of bright colors. 
 I smiled. 
The mouth in the mirror cracked into a grin. 
A minute after the crash another nurse ran in. She took one look at the broken mirror, and at me, standing over the blind, white pieces, and hustled the young nurse out of the room. 
 "Didn't I tell you," I could hear her say. 
"But I only. . ." 
 "Didn't I tell you!" 
I listened with mild interest. Anybody could drop a mirror. I didn't see why they should get so stirred up. 
The other, older nurse came back into the room. She stood there, arms folded, staring hard at me. 
"Seven years' bad luck" 
 "What?" 
"I said," the nurse raised her voice, as if speaking to a deaf person, "seven years' bad luck." 
The young nurse returned with a dustpan and brush and began to sweep up the glittery splinters. 
"That's only a superstition," I said then. 
"Huh!" The second nurse addressed herself to the nurse on her hands and knees as if I wasn't there. "At you-know-where they'll take care of her!" 
From the back window of the ambulance I could see street after familiar street funneling off into a summery green distance. My mother sat on one side of me, and my brother on the other. 
I had pretended I didn't know why they were moving me from the hospital in my home town to a city hospital, to see what they would say. 
"They want you to be in a special ward," my mother said. "They don't have that sort of ward at our hospital." 
"I liked it where I was." 
My mother's mouth tightened. "You should have behaved better, then." 
 "What?" 
"You shouldn't have broken that mirror. Then maybe they'd have let you stay." 
But of course I knew the mirror had nothing to do with it 
I sat in bed with the covers up to my neck. 
"Why can't I get up? I'm not sick." 
"Ward rounds," the nurse said. "You can get up after ward rounds." She shoved the bed curtains back and revealed a fat young Italian woman in the next bed. 
The Italian woman had a mass of tight black curls, starting at her forehead, that rose in a mountainous pompadour and cascaded down her back. Whenever she moved, the huge arrangement of hair moved with her, as if made of stiff black paper. 
The woman looked at me and giggled. "Why are you here?" She didn't wait for an answer. "I'm here on account of my French-Canadian mother-in-law." She giggled again. "My husband knows I can't stand her, and still he said she could come and visit us, and when she came, my tongue stuck out of my head, I couldn't stop it. They ran me into Emergency and then they put me up here," she lowered her voice, "along with the nuts." Then she said, "What's the matter with you?" 
I turned her my full face, with the bulging purple and green eye. "I tried to kill myself." 
The woman stared at me. Then, hastily, she snatched up a movie magazine from her bed table and pretended to be reading. 
The swinging door opposite my bed flew open, and a whole troop of young boys and girls in white coats came in, with an older, gray-haired man. They were all smiling with bright, artificial smiles. They grouped themselves at the foot of my bed. 
"And how are you feeling this morning, Miss Greenwood?" 
I tried to decide which one of them had spoken. I hate saying anything to a group of people. When I talk to a group of people I always have to single out one and talk to him, and all the while I am talking I feel the others are peering at me and taking unfair advantage. I also hate people to ask cheerfully how you are when they know you're feeling like hell and expect you to say "Fine." 
 "I feel lousy." 
"Lousy. Hmm," somebody said, and a boy ducked his head with a little smile. Somebody else scribbled something on a clipboard. Then somebody pulled a straight, solemn face and said, "And why do you feel lousy?" 
I thought some of the boys and girls in that bright group might well be friends of Buddy Willard. They would know I knew him, and they would be curious to see me, and afterward they would gossip about me among themselves. I wanted to be where nobody I knew could ever come. 
"I can't sleep. . ." 
They interrupted me. "But the nurse says you slept last night." I looked around the crescent of fresh, strange faces. 
"I can't read." I raised my voice. "I can't eat." It occurred to me I'd been eating ravenously ever since I came to. 
The people in the group had turned from me and were murmuring in low voices to each other. Finally, the gray-haired man stepped out. 
"Thank you, Miss Greenwood. You will be seen by one of the staff doctors presently." 
Then the group moved on to the bed of the Italian woman. 
"And how are you feeling today, Mrs. . ." somebody said, and the name sounded long and full of I's, like Mrs. Tomolillo. 
Mrs. Tomolillo giggled. "Oh, I'm fine, doctor. I'm just fine." Then she lowered her voice and whispered something I couldn't hear. One or two people in the group glanced in my direction. Then somebody said, "All right, Mrs. Tomolillo," and somebody stepped out and pulled the bed curtain between us like a white wall 
I sat on one end of a wooden bench in the grassy square between the four brick walls of the hospital. My mother, in her purple cartwheel dress, sat at the other end. She had her head propped in her hand, index finger on her cheek and thumb under her chin. 
Mrs. Tomolillo was sitting with some dark-haired, laughing Italians on the nest bench down. Every time my mother moved, Mrs. Tomolillo imitated her. Now Mrs. Tomolillo was sitting with her index finger on her cheek and her thumb under her chin, and her head tilted wistfully to one side. 
"Don't move," I told my mother in a low voice. "That woman's imitating you." 
My mother turned to glance round, but quick as a wink, Mrs. Tomolillo dropped her fat white hands in her lap and started talking vigorously to her friends. 
"Why no, she's not," my mother said. "She's not even paying any attention to us." 
But the minute my mother turned round to me again, Mrs. Tomolillo matched the tips of her fingers together the way my mother had just done and cast a black, mocking look at me. 
The lawn was white with doctors. 
All the time my mother and I had been sitting there, in the narrow cone of sun that shone down between the tall brick walls, doctors had been coming up to me and introducing themselves. "I'm Doctor Soandso, I'm Doctor Soandso." 
Some of them looked so young I knew they couldn't be proper doctors, and one of them had a queer name that sounded just like Doctor Syphilis, so I began to look out for suspicious, fake names, and sure enough, a dark-haired fellow who looked very like Doctor Gordon, except that he had black skin where Doctor Gordon's skin was white, came up and said, "I'm Doctor Pancreas," and shook my hand. 
After introducing themselves, the doctors all stood within listening distance, only I couldn't tell my mother that they were taking down every word we said without their hearing me, so I leaned over and whispered into her ear. 
My mother drew back sharply. 
"Oh, Esther, I wish you would cooperate. They say you don't cooperate. They say you won't talk to any of the doctors or make anything in Occupational Therapy. . ." 
"I've got to get out of here," I told her meaningly. "Then I'd be all right. You got me in here," I said. "You get me out." 
I thought if only I could persuade my mother to get me out of the hospital I could work on her sympathies, like that boy with brain disease in the play, and convince her what was the best thing to do. 
To my surprise, my mother said, "All right, I'll try to get you out -- even if only to a better place. If I try to get you out," she laid a hand on my knee, "promise you'll be good?" 
I spun round and glared straight at Doctor Syphilis, who stood at my elbow taking notes on a tiny, almost invisible pad. "I promise," I said in a loud, conspicuous voice. 
The Negro wheeled the food cart into the patients' dining room. The Psychiatric Ward at the hospital was very small -- just two corridors in an L-shape, lined with rooms, and an alcove of beds behind the OT shop, where I was, and a little area with a table and a few seats by a window in the corner of the L, which was our lounge and dining room. 
Usually it was a shrunken old white man that brought our food, but today it was a Negro. The Negro was with a woman in blue stiletto heels, and she was telling him what to do. The Negro kept grinning and chuckling in a silly way. 
Then he carried a tray over to our table with three lidded tin tureens on it, and started banging the tureens down. The woman left the room, locking the door behind her. All the time the Negro was banging down the tureens and then the dinted silver and the thick, white china plates, he gawped at us with big, rolling eyes. 
I could tell we were his first crazy people. 
Nobody at the table made a move to take the lids off the tin tureens, and the nurse stood back to see if any of us would take the lids off before she came to do it. Usually Mrs. Tomolillo had taken the lids off and dished out everybody's food like a little mother, but then they sent her home, and nobody seemed to want to take her place. 
I was starving, so I lifted the lid off the first bowl. 
"That's very nice of you, Esther," the nurse said pleasantly. "Would you like to take some beans and pass them round to the others?" 
I dished myself out a helping of green string beans and turned to pass the tureen to the enormous red-headed woman at my right. This was the first time the red-headed woman had been allowed up to the table. I had seen her once, at, the end of the L-shaped corridor, standing in front of an open door with bars on the square, inset windows. 
She had been yelling and laughing in a rude way and slapping her thighs at the passing doctors, and the white-jacketed attendant who took care of the people in that end of the ward was leaning against the radiator, laughing himself sick. 
The red-headed woman snatched the tureen from me and upended it on her plate. Beans mountained up in front of her and scattered over onto her lap and onto the floor like stiff, green straws. 
"Oh, Mrs. Mole!" the nurse said in a sad voice. "I think you better eat in your room today." 
And she returned most of the beans to the tureen and gave it to the person next to Mrs. Mole and led Mrs. Mole off. All the way down the hall to her room, Mrs. Mole kept turning round and making leering faces at us, and ugly, oinking noises. 
The Negro had come back and was starting to collect the empty plates of people who hadn't dished out any beans yet. 
"We're not done," I told him. "You can just wait." 
"Mah, mah!" The Negro widened his eyes in mock wonder. He glanced round. The nurse had not yet returned from locking up Mrs. Mole. The Negro made me an insolent bow. "Miss Mucky-Muck," he said under his breath. 
I lifted the lid off the second tureen and uncovered a wedge of macaroni, stone-cold and stuck together in a gluey paste. The third and last tureen was chock-full of baked beans. 
Now I knew perfectly well you didn't serve two kinds of beans together at a meal. Beans and carrots, or beans and peas, maybe, but never beans and beans. The Negro was just trying to see how much we would take. 
The nurse came back, and the Negro edged off at a distance. I ate as much as I could of the baked beans. Then I rose from the table, passing round to the side where the nurse couldn't see me below the waist, and behind the Negro, who was clearing the dirty plates. I drew my foot back and gave him a sharp, hard kick on the calf of the leg. 
The Negro leapt away with a yelp and rolled his eyes at me. "Oh Miz, oh Miz," he moaned, rubbing his leg. "You shouldn't of done that, you shouldn't, you reely shouldn't."  
 "That's what you get," I said, and stared him in the eye. 
"Don't you want to get up today?" 
"No." I huddled down more deeply in the bed and pulled the sheet up over my head. Then I lifted a corner of the sheet and peered out. The nurse was shaking down the thermometer she had just removed from my mouth. 
"You see, it's normal." I had looked at the thermometer before she came to collect it, the way I always did. "You see, it's normal, what do you keep taking it for?" 
I wanted to tell her that if only something were wrong with my body it would be fine, I would rather have anything wrong with my body than something wrong with my head, but the idea seemed so involved and wearisome that I didn't say anything. I only burrowed down further in the bed. 
Then, through the sheet, I felt a slight, annoying pressure on my leg. I peeped out. The nurse had set her tray of thermometers on my bed while she turned her back and took the pulse of the person who lay next to me, in Mrs. Tomolillo's place. 
A heavy naughtiness pricked through my veins, irritating and attractive as the hurt of a loose tooth. I yawned and stirred, as if about to turn over, and edged my foot under the box. 
"Oh!" The nurse's cry sounded like a cry for help, and another nurse came running. "Look what you've done!" 
I poked my head out of the covers and stared over the edge of the bed. Around the overturned enamel tray, a star of thermometer shards glittered, and balls of mercury trembled like celestial dew. 
"I'm sorry," I said. "It was an accident." 
The second nurse fixed me with a baleful eye. "You did it on purpose. I saw you." 
Then she hurried off, and almost immediately two attendants came and wheeled me, bed and all, down to Mrs. Mole's old room, but not before I had scooped up a ball of mercury. 
Soon after they had locked the door, I could see the Negro's face, a molasses-colored moon, risen at the window grating, but I pretended not to notice. 
I opened my fingers a crack, like a child with a secret, and smiled at the silver globe cupped in my palm. If I dropped it, it would break into a million little replicas of itself, and if I pushed them near each other, they would fuse, without a crack, into one whole again. 
I smiled and smiled at the small silver ball. 
I couldn't imagine what they had done with Mrs. Mole. 

Fifteen
 PHILOMENA GUINEA'S black Cadillac eased through the tight, five o'clock traffic like a ceremonial car. Soon it would cross one of the brief bridges that arched the Charles, and I would, without thinking, open the door and plunge out through the stream of traffic to the rail of the bridge. One jump and the water would be over my head. 
Idly I twisted a Kleenex to small, pill-sized pellets between my fingers and watched my chance. I sat in the middle of the back seat of the Cadillac, my mother on one side of me, and my brother on the other, both leaning slightly forward, like diagonal bars, one across each car door. 
In front of me I could see the Spam-colored expanse of the chauffeur's neck, sandwiched between a blue cap and the shoulders of a blue jacket and, next to him, like a frail, exotic bird, the silver hair and emerald-feathered hat of Philomena Guinea, the famous novelist. 
I wasn't quite sure why Mrs. Guinea had turned up. All I knew was that she had interested herself in my case and that at one time, at the peak of her career, she had been in an asylum as well 
My mother said that Mrs. Guinea had sent her a telegram from the Bahamas, where she read about me in a Boston paper. Mrs. Guinea had telegrammed, "Is there a boy in the case?" 
If there was a boy in the case, Mrs. Guinea couldn't, of course, have anything to do with it. 
But my mother had telegrammed back, "No, it is Esther's writing. She thinks she will never write again." 
So Mrs. Guinea had flown back to Boston and taken me out of the cramped city hospital ward, and now she was driving me to a private hospital that had grounds and golf courses and gardens, like a country club, where she would pay for me, as if I had a scholarship, until the doctors she knew of there had made me well. 
My mother told me I should be grateful. She said I had used up almost all her money, and if it weren't for Mrs. Guinea she didn't know where I'd be. I knew where I'd be though. I'd be in the big state hospital in the country, cheek by jowl to this private place. 
I knew I should be grateful to Mrs. Guinea, only I couldn't feel a thing. If Mrs. Guinea had given me a ticket to Europe, or a round-the-world cruise, it wouldn't have made one scrap of difference to me, because wherever I sat -- on the deck of a ship or at a street cafÈ in Paris or Bangkok -- I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air. 
Blue sky opened its dome above the river, and the river was dotted with sails. I readied myself, but immediately my mother and my brother each laid one hand on a door handle. The tires hummed briefly over the grill of the bridge. Water, sails, blue sky and suspended gulls flashed by like an improbable postcard, and we were across. 
I sank back in the gray, plush seat and closed my eyes. The air of the bell jar wadded round me and I couldn't stir. 
I had my own room again. 
It reminded me of the room in Doctor Gordon's hospital -- a bed, a bureau, a closet, a table and chair. A window with a screen, but no bars. My room was on the first floor, and the window, a short distance above the pine-needle-padded ground, overlooked a wooded yard ringed by a red brick wall. If I jumped I wouldn't even bruise my knees. The inner surface of the tall wall seemed smooth as glass. 
The journey over the bridge had unnerved me. 
I had missed a perfectly good chance. The river water passed me by like an untouched drink. I suspected that even if my mother and brother had not been there I would have made no move to jump. 
When I enrolled in the main building of the hospital, a slim young woman had come and introduced herself. "My name is Doctor Nolan. I am to be Esther's doctor." 
I was surprised to have a woman. I didn't think they had woman psychiatrists. This woman was a cross between Myrna Loy and my mother. She wore a white blouse and a full skirt gathered at the waist by a wide leather belt, and stylish, crescent-shaped spectacles. 
But after a nurse had led me across the lawn to the gloomy brick building called Caplan, where I would live, Doctor Nolan didn't come to see me, a whole lot of strange men came instead. 
I lay on my bed under the thick white blanket, and they entered my room, one by one, and introduced themselves. I couldn't understand why there should be so many of them, or why they would want to introduce themselves, and I began to think they were testing me, to see if I noticed there were too many of them, and I grew wary. 
Finally, a handsome, white-haired doctor came in and said he was the director of the hospital. Then he started talking about the Pilgrims and Indians and who had the land after them, and what rivers ran nearby, and who had built the first hospital, and how it had burned down, and who had built the next hospital, until I thought he must be waiting to see when I would interrupt him and tell him I knew all that about rivers and Pilgrims was a lot of nonsense. 
But then I thought some of it might be true, so I tried to sort out what was likely to be true and what wasn't, only before I could do that, he had said good-bye. 
I waited till I heard the voices of all the doctors die away. Then I threw back the white blanket and put on my shoes and walked out into the hall. Nobody stopped me, so I walked round the corner of my wing of the hall and down another, longer hall, past an open dining room. 
A maid in a green uniform was setting the tables for supper. There were white linen tablecloths and glasses and paper napkins. I stored the fact that they were real glasses in the corner of my mind the way a squirrel stores a nut. At the city hospital we had drunk out of paper cups and had no knives to cut our meat. The meat had always been so overcooked we could cut it with a fork. 
Finally I arrived at a big lounge with shabby furniture and a threadbare rug. A girl with a round pasty face and short black hair was sitting in an armchair, reading a magazine. She reminded me of a Girl Scout leader I'd had once. I glanced at her feet, and sure enough, she wore those flat brown leather shoes with fringed tongues lapping down over the front that are supposed to be so sporty, and the ends of the laces were knobbed with little imitation acorns. 
The girl raised her eyes and smiled. "I'm Valerie. Who are you?" 
I pretended I hadn't heard and walked out of the lounge to the end of the next wing. On the way, I passed a waist-high door behind which I saw some nurses. 
"Where is everybody?" 
"Out." The nurse was writing something over and over on little pieces of adhesive tape. I leaned across the gate of the door to see what she was writing, and it was E. Greenwood, E. Greenwood, E. Greenwood, E. Greenwood. 
 "Out where?" 
"Oh, OT, the golf course, playing badminton." 
I noticed a pile of clothes on a chair beside the nurse. They were the same clothes the nurse in the first hospital had been packing into the patent leather case when I broke the mirror. The nurses began sticking the labels onto the clothes. 
I walked back to the lounge. I couldn't understand what these people were doing, playing badminton and golf. They mustn't be really sick at all, to do that. 
I sat down near Valerie and observed her carefully. Yes, I thought, she might just as well be in a Girl Scout camp. She was reading her tatty copy of Vogue with intense interest. 
''What the hell is she doing here?" I wondered. "There's nothing the matter with her." 
"Do you mind if I smoke?" Doctor Nolan leaned back in the armchair next to my bed. 
I said no, I liked the smell of smoke. I thought if Doctor Nolan smoked, she might stay longer. This was the first time she had come to talk with me. When she left I would simply lapse into the old blankness. 
"Tell me about Doctor Gordon," Doctor Nolan said suddenly. "Did you like him?" 
I gave Doctor Nolan a wary look. I thought the doctors must all be in it together, and that somewhere in this hospital, in a hidden corner, there reposed a machine exactly like Doctor Gordon's, ready to jolt me out of my skin. 
"No," I said. "I didn't like him at all." 
"That's interesting. Why?" 
"I didn't like what he did to me." 
"Did to you?" 
I told Doctor Nolan about the machine, and the blue flashes, and the jolting and the noise. While I was telling her she went very still. 
"That was a mistake," she said then. "It's not supposed to be like that." 
I stared at her. 
"If it's done properly," Doctor Nolan said, "it's like going to sleep." 
"If anyone does that to me again I'll kill myself." 
Doctor Nolan said firmly, "You won't have any shock treatments here. Or if you do," she amended, "I'll tell you about it beforehand, and I promise you it won't be anything like what you had before. Why," she finished, "some people even like them." 
After Doctor Nolan had gone I found a box of matches on the windowsill. It wasn't an ordinary-size box, but an extremely tiny box. I opened it and exposed a row of little white sticks with pink tips. I tried to light one, and it crumpled in my hand. 
I couldn't think why Doctor Nolan would have left me such a stupid thing. Perhaps she wanted to see if I would give it back. Carefully I stored the toy matches in the hem of my new wool bathrobe. If Doctor Nolan asked me for the matches, I would say I'd thought they were made of candy and had eaten them. 
A new woman had moved into the room next to mine.  
I thought she must be the only person in the building who was newer than I was, so she wouldn't know how really bad I was, the way the rest did. I thought I might go in and make friends. 
The woman was lying on her bed in a purple dress that fastened at the neck with a cameo brooch and reached midway between her knees and her shoes. She had rusty hair knotted in a schoolmarmish bun, and thin, silver-rimmed spectacles attached to her breast pocket with a black elastic. 
"Hello," I said conversationally, sitting down on the edge of the bed. "My name's Esther, what's your name?" 
The woman didn't stir, just stared up at the ceiling. I felt hurt. I thought maybe Valerie or somebody had told her when she first came in how stupid I was. 
A nurse popped her head in at the door. 
"Oh, there you are," she said to me. "Visiting Miss Norris. How nice!" And she disappeared again. 
I don't know how long I sat there, watching the woman in purple and wondering if her pursed pink lips would open, and if they did open, what they would say. 
Finally, without speaking or looking at me, Miss Norris swung her feet in their high, black, buttoned boots over the other side of the bed and walked out of the room. I thought she might be trying to get rid of me in a subtle way. Quietly, at a little distance, I followed her down the hall. 
Miss Norris reached the door of the dining room and paused. All the way to the dining room she had walked precisely, placing her feet in the very center of the cabbage roses that twined through the pattern of the carpet. She waited a moment and then, one by one, lifted her feet over the doorsill and into the dining room as though stepping over an invisible shin-high stile. 
She sat down at one of the round, linen-covered tables and unfolded a napkin in her lap. 
"It's not supper for an hour yet," the cook called out of the kitchen. 
But Miss Norris didn't answer. She just stared straight ahead of her in a polite way. 
I pulled up a chair opposite her at the table and unfolded a napkin. We didn't speak, but sat there, in a dose, sisterly silence, until the gong for supper sounded down the hall 
"Lie down," the nurse said. "I'm going to give you another injection." 
I rolled over on my stomach on the bed and hitched up my skirt. Then I pulled down the trousers of my silk pajamas. 
"My word, what all have you got under there?" 
"Pajamas. So I won't have to bother getting in and out of them all the time." 
The nurse made a little ducking noise. Then she said, "Which side?" It was an old joke. 
I raised my head and glanced back at my bare buttocks. They were bruised purple and green and blue from past injections. The left side looked darker than the right 
 "The right." 
"You name it." The nurse jabbed the needle in, and I winced, savoring the tiny hurt. Three times each day the nurses injected me, and about an hour after each injection they gave me a cup of sugary fruit juice and stood by, watching me drink it. 
"Lucky you," Valerie said. "You're on insulin." 
 "Nothing happens." 
"Oh, it will. I've had it. Tell me when you get a reaction." 
But I never seemed to get any reaction. I just grew fatter and fatter. Already I filled the new, too-big clothes my mother had bought, and when I peered down at my plump stomach and my broad hips I thought it was a good thing Mrs. Guinea hadn't seen me like this, because I looked just as if I were going to have a baby. 
"Have you seen my scars?" 
Valerie pushed aside her black bang and indicated two pale marks, one on either side of her forehead, as if at some time she had started to sprout horns, but cut them off. 
We were walking, just the two of us, with the Sports Therapist in the asylum gardens. Nowadays I was let out on walk privileges more and more often. They never let Miss Norris out at all. 
Valerie said Miss Norris shouldn't be in Caplan, but in a building for worse people called Wymark. 
"Do you know what these scars are?" Valerie persisted. 
"No. What are they?" 
"I've had a lobotomy." 
I looked at Valerie in awe, appreciating for the first time her perpetual marble calm. "How do you feel?" 
"Fine. I'm not angry any more. Before, I was always angry. I was in Wymark before, and now I'm in Caplan. I can go to town, now, or shopping or to a movie, along with a nurse." 
"What will you do when you get out?" 
"Oh, I'm not leaving," Valerie laughed. "I like it here." 
 "Moving day!" 
"Why should I be moving?" 
The nurse went on blithely opening and shutting my drawers, emptying the closet and folding my belongings into the black overnight case. 
I thought they must at last be moving me to Wymark. "Oh, you're only moving to the front of the house," the nurse said cheerfully. "You'll like it. There's lots more sun." 
When we came out into the hall, I saw that Miss Norris was moving too. A nurse, young and cheerful as my own, stood in the doorway of Miss Norris's room, helping Miss Norris into a purple coat with a scrawny squirrel-fur collar. 
Hour after hour I had been keeping watch by Miss Norris's bedside, refusing the diversion of OT and walks and badminton matches and even the weekly movies, which I enjoyed, and which Miss Norris never went to, simply to brood over the pale, speechless circlet of her lips. 
I thought how exciting it would be if she opened her mouth and spoke, and I rushed out into the hall and announced this to the nurses. They would praise me for encouraging Miss Norris, and I would probably be allowed shopping privileges and movie privileges downtown, and my escape would be assured. 
But in all my hours of vigil Miss Norris hadn't said a word. 
"Where are you moving to?" I asked her now. 
The nurse touched Miss Norris's elbow, and Miss Norris jerked into motion like a doll on wheels. 
"She's going to Wymark," my nurse told me in a low voice. "I'm afraid Miss Norris isn't moving up like you." 
I watched Miss Norris lift one foot, and then the other, over the invisible stile that barred the front doorsill. 
"I've a surprise for you," the nurse said as she installed me in a sunny room in the front wing overlooking the green golf links. "Somebody you know's just come today." 
 "Somebody I know?" 
The nurse laughed. "Don't look at me like that. It's not a policeman." Then, as I didn't say anything, she added, "She says she's an old friend of yours. She lives next door. Why don't you pay her a visit?" 
I thought the nurse must be joking, and that if I knocked on the door next to mine I would hear no answer, but go in and find Miss Norris, buttoned into her purple, squirrel-collared coat and lying on the bed, her mouth blooming out of the quiet vase of her body like the bud of a rose. 
Still, I went out and knocked on the neighboring door. 
"Come in!" called a gay voice. 
I opened the door a crack and peered into the room. The big, horsey girl in jodhpurs sitting by the window glanced up with a broad smile. 
"Esther!" She sounded out of breath, as if she had been running a long, long distance and only just come to a halt. "How nice to see you. They told me you were here." 
"Joan?" I said tentatively, then "Joan!" in confusion and disbelief. 
Joan beamed, revealing her large, gleaming, unmistakable teeth. "It's really me. I thought you'd be surprised." 

Sixteen 
Joan's room, with its closet and bureau and table and chair and white blanket with the big blue C on it, was a mirror image of my own. It occurred to me that Joan, hearing where I was, had engaged a room at the asylum on pretense, simply as a joke. That would explain why she had told the nurse I was her friend. I had never known Joan, except at a cool distance. 
"How did you get here?" I curled up on Joan's bed. 
"I read about you," Joan said. 
 "What?" 
"I read about you, and I ran away," 
"How do you mean?" I said evenly. 
"Well," Joan leaned back in the chintz-flowered asylum armchair, "I had a summer job working for the chapter head of some fraternity, like the Masons, you know, but not the Masons, and I felt terrible. I had these bunions, I could hardly walk -- in the last days I had to wear rubber boots to work, instead of shoes, and you can imagine what that did to my morale. . ." 
I thought either Joan must be crazy -- wearing rubber boots to work -- or she must be trying to see how crazy I was, believing all that. Besides, only old people ever got bunions. I decided to pretend I thought she was crazy, and that I was only humoring her along. 
"I always feel lousy without shoes," I said with an ambiguous smile. "Did your feet hurt much?" 
"Terribly. And my boss -- he'd just separated from his wife, he couldn't come right out and get a divorce, because that wouldn't go with this fraternal order -- my boss kept buzzing me in every other minute, and each time I moved my feet hurt like the devil, but the second I'd sit down at my desk again, buzz went the buzzer, and he'd have something else he wanted to get off his chest. . ." 
"Why didn't you quit?" 
"Oh, I did quit, more or less. I stayed off work on sick leave. I didn't go out. I didn't see anyone. I stowed the telephone in a drawer and never answered it... 
"Then my doctor sent me to a psychiatrist at this big hospital I had an appointment for twelve o'clock, and I was in an awful state. Finally, at half past twelve, the receptionist came out and told me the doctor had gone to lunch. She asked me if I wanted to wait, and I said yes." 
"Did he come back?" The story sounded rather involved for Joan to have made up out of whole cloth, but I led her on, to see what would come of it. 
"Oh yes. I was going to kill myself, mind you. I said 'If this doctor doesn't do the trick, that's the end.' Well, the receptionist led me down a long hall, and just as we got to the door she turned to me and said, 'You won't mind if there are a few students with the doctor, will you?' What could I say? 'Oh no,' I said. I walked in and found nine pairs of eyes fixed on me. Nine! Eighteen separate eyes. 
"Now, if that receptionist had told me there were going to be nine people in that room, I'd have walked out on the spot. But there I was, and it was too late to do a thing about it. Well, on this particular day I happened to be wearing a fur coat. . ."  
 "In August?" 
"Oh, it was one of those cold, wet days, and I thought, my first psychiatrist -- you know. Anyway, this psychiatrist kept eyeing that fur coat the whole time I talked to him, and I could just see what he thought of my asking to pay the student's cut rate instead of the full fee. I could see the dollar signs in his eyes. Well, I told him I don't know whatall ≠
- about the bunions and the telephone in the drawer and how I wanted to kill myself -- and then he asked me to wait outside while he discussed my case with the others, and when he called me back in, you know what he said?"  
 "What?" 
"He folded his hands together and looked at me and said, 'Miss Gilling, we have decided that you would benefit by group therapy.' " 
"Group therapy?" I thought I must sound phony as an echo chamber, but Joan didn't pay any notice. 
"That's what he said. Can you imagine me wanting to kill myself, and coming round to chat about it with a whole pack of strangers, and most of them no better than myself. . ." 
"That's crazy." I was growing involved in spite of myself. "That's not even human." 
"That's just what I said. I went straight home and wrote that doctor a letter. I wrote him one beautiful letter about how a man like that had no business setting himself up to help sick people. . ." 
"Did you get any answer?" 
"I don't know. That was the day I read about you." 
"How do you mean?" 
"Oh," Joan said, "about how the police thought you were dead and all. I've got a pile of clippings somewhere." She heaved herself up, and I had a strong horsey whiff that made my nostrils prickle. Joan had been a champion horse-jumper at the annual college gymkhana, and I wondered if she had been sleeping in a stable. 
Joan rummaged in her open suitcase and came up with a fistful of clippings. 
"Here, have a look." 
The first clipping showed a big, blown-up picture of a girl with black-shadowed 
eyes and black lips spread in a grin. I couldn't imagine where such a tarty picture had been taken until I noticed the Bloomingdale earrings and the Bloomingdale necklace glinting out of it with bright, white highlights, like imitation stars. 
SCHOLARSHIP GIRL MISSING. MOTHER WORRIED 
The article under the picture told how this girl had disappeared from her home on August 17th, wearing a green skirt and a white blouse, and had left a note saying she was taking a long walk. When Miss Greenwood had not returned by midnight, it said, her 
mother called the town police. 
The next clipping showed a picture of my mother and brother and me grouped together in our backyard and smiling. I couldn't think who had taken that picture either, until I saw I was wearing dungarees and white sneakers and remembered that was what I wore in my spinach-picking summer, and how Dodo Conway had dropped by and taken some family snaps of the three of us one hot afternoon. Mrs. Greenwood asked that this picture be printed in hopes that it will encourage her daughter to return home. 
SLEEPING PILLS FEARED MISSING WITH GIRL 
A dark, midnight picture of about a dozen moon-faced people in a wood. I thought the people at the end of the row looked queer and unusually short until I realized they were not people, but dogs. Bloodhounds used in search for missing girl. Police Sgt. Bill Mindly says: It doesn't look good. 
GIRL FOUND ALIVE! 
The last picture showed policemen lifting a long, limp blanket roll with a featureless cabbage head into the back of an ambulance. Then it told how my mother had been down in the cellar, doing the week's laundry, when she heard faint groans coming from a disused hole. . . 
I laid the clippings on the white spread of the bed. 
"You keep them," Joan said. "You ought to stick them in a scrapbook." 
I folded the clippings and slipped them in my pocket. 
"I read about you," Joan went on. "Not how they found you, but everything up to that, and I put all my money together and took the first plane to New York." 
"Why New York?" 
"Oh, I thought it would be easier to kill myself in New York." 
"What did you do?" 
Joan grinned sheepishly and stretched out her hands, palm up. Like a miniature mountain range, large reddish weals upheaved across the white flesh of her wrists. 
"How did you do that?" For the first time it occurred to me Joan and I might have something in common. 
"I shoved my fists through my roommate's window." 
 "What roommate?" 
"My old college roommate. She was working in New York, and I couldn't think of anyplace else to stay, and besides, I'd hardly any money left, so I went to stay with her. My parents found me there -- she'd written them I was acting funny -- and my father flew straight down and brought me back." 
"But you're all right now." I made it a statement. 
Joan considered me with her bright, pebble-gray eyes. "I guess so," she said. "Aren't you?" 
I had fallen asleep after the evening meal. 
I was awakened by a loud voice. Mrs. Bannister, Mrs. Bannister, Mrs. Bannister, Mrs. Bannister. As I pulled out of sleep, I found I was beating on the bedpost with my hands and calling. The sharp, wry figure of Mrs. Bannister, the night nurse, scurried into 
view. 
"Here, we don't want you to break this." 
She unfastened the band of my watch. 
"What's the matter? What happened?" 
Mrs. Bannister's face twisted into a quick smile. "You've had a reaction." 
 "A reaction?" 
"Yes, how do you feel?" 
"Funny. Sort of light and airy." 
Mrs. Bannister helped me sit up. 
"You'll be better now. You'll be better in no time. Would you like some hot milk?" 
"Yes." 
And when Mrs. Bannister held the cup to my lips, I fanned the hot milk out on my tongue as it went down, tasting it luxuriously, the way a baby tastes its mother. 
"Mrs. Bannister tells me you had a reaction." Doctor Nolan seated herself in the armchair by the window and took out a tiny box of matches. The box looked exactly like the one I had hidden in the hem of my bathrobe, and for a moment I wondered if a nurse had discovered it there and given it back to Doctor Nolan on the quiet. 
Doctor Nolan scraped a match on the side of the box. A hot yellow flame jumped into life, and I watched her suck it up into the cigarette. 
"Mrs. B. says you felt better." 
"I did for a while. Now I'm the same again." 
"I've news for you." 
I waited. Every day now, for I didn't know how many days, I had spent the mornings and afternoons and evenings wrapped up in my white blanket on the deck chair in the alcove, pretending to read. I had a dim notion that Doctor Nolan was allowing me a certain number of days and then she would say just what Doctor Gordon had said: "I'm sorry, you don't seem to have improved, I think you'd better have some shock treatment. . ." 
"Well, don't you want to hear what it is?" 
"What?" I said dully, and braced myself. 
"You're not to have any more visitors for a while." 
I stared at Doctor Nolan in surprise. "Why that's wonderful." 
"I thought you'd be pleased." She smiled. 
Then I looked, and Doctor Nolan looked, at the wastebasket beside my bureau. Out of the wastebasket poked the blood-red buds of a dozen long-stemmed roses. 
That afternoon my mother had come to visit me. 
My mother was only one in a long stream of visitors -- my former employer, the lady Christian Scientist, who walked on the lawn with me and talked about the mist going up from the earth in the Bible, and the mist being error, and my whole trouble being that I believed in the mist, and the minute I stopped believing in it, it would disappear and I would see I had always been well, and the English teacher I had in high school who came and tried to teach me how to play Scrabble, because he thought it might revive my old interest in words, and Philomena Guinea herself, who wasn't at all satisfied with what the doctors were doing and kept telling them so. 
I hated these visits. 
I would be sitting in my alcove or in my room, and a smiling nurse would pop in and announce one or another of the visitors. Once they'd even brought the minister of thef Unitarian church, whom I'd never really liked at all. He was terribly nervous the whole time, and I could tell he thought I was crazy as a loon, because I told him I believed in hell, and that certain people, like me, had to live in hell before they died, to make up for missing out on it after death, since they didn't believe in life after death, and what each person believed happened to him when he died.   
I hated these visits, because I kept feeling the visitors measuring my fat and stringy hair against what I had been and what they wanted me to be, and I knew they went away utterly confounded. 
I thought if they left me alone I might have some peace.  
My mother was the worst. She never scolded me, but kept begging me, with a sorrowful face, to tell her what she had done wrong. She said she was sure the doctors thought she had done something wrong because they asked her a lot of questions about my toilet training, and I had been perfectly trained at a very early age and given her no trouble whatsoever. 
That afternoon my mother had brought me the roses. 
"Save them for my funeral," I'd said. 
My mother's face puckered, and she looked ready to cry. 
"But Esther, don't you remember what day it is today?" 
"No." 
I thought it might be Saint Valentine's day. "It's your birthday." 
And that was when I had dumped the roses in the waste-basket. 
"That was a silly thing for her to do," I said to Doctor Nolan. 
Doctor Nolan nodded. She seemed to know what I meant. "I hate her," I said, and waited for the blow to fall. 
But Doctor Nolan only smiled at me as if something had pleased her very, very much, and said, "I suppose you do." 

Seventeen 
"You're a lucky girl today." 
The young nurse cleared my breakfast tray away and left me wrapped in my white blanket like a passenger taking the sea air on the deck of a ship. 
"Why am I lucky?" 
"Well, I'm not sure if you're supposed to know yet, but today, you're moving to Belsize." The nurse looked at me expectantly. 
"Belsize," I said. "I can't go there." 
 "Why not?" 
"I'm not ready. I'm not well enough." 
"Of course, you're well enough. Don't worry, they wouldn't be moving you if you weren't well enough." 
After the nurse left, I tried to puzzle out this new move on Doctor Nolan's part. What was she trying to prove? I hadn't changed. Nothing had changed. And Belsize was the best house of all. From Belsize people went back to work and back to school and back to their homes. 
Joan would be at Belsize. Joan with her physics books and her golf clubs and her badminton rackets and her breathy voice. Joan, marking the gulf between me and the nearly well ones. Ever since Joan left Caplan I'd followed her progress through the asylum grapevine. 
Joan had walk privileges, Joan had shopping privileges, Joan had town privileges. I gathered all my news of Joan into a little, bitter heap, though I received it with surface gladness. Joan was the beaming double of my old best self, specially designed to follow and torment me. 
Perhaps Joan would be gone when I got to Belsize. 
At least at Belsize I could forget about shock treatments. At Caplan a lot of the women had shock treatments. I could tell which ones they were, because they didn't get their breakfast trays with the rest of us. They had their shock treatments while we breakfasted in our rooms, and then they came into the lounge, quiet and extinguished, led like children by the nurses, and ate their breakfasts there. 
Each morning, when I heard the nurse knock with my tray, an immense relief flooded through me, because I knew I was out of danger for that day. I didn't see how Doctor Nolan could tell you went to sleep during a shock treatment if she'd never had a shock treatment herself. How did she know the person didn't just look as if he was asleep, while all the time, inside, he was feeling the blue volts and the noise? 
Piano music sounded from the end of the hall. 
At supper I sat quietly, listening to the chatter of the Belsize women. They were all fashionably dressed and carefully made up, and several of them were married. Some of them had been shopping downtown, and others had been out visiting friends, and all during supper they kept tossing back and forth these private jokes. 
"I'd call Jack," a woman named DeeDee said, "only I'm afraid he wouldn't be home. I know just where I could call him, though, and he'd be in, all right." 
The short, spry blonde woman at my table laughed. "I almost had Doctor Loring where I wanted him today." She widened her starey blue eyes like a little doll. "I wouldn't mind trading old Percy in for a new model." 
At the opposite end of the room, Joan was wolfing her Spam and broiled tomato with great appetite. She seemed perfectly at home among these women and treated me coolly, with a slight sneer, like a dim and inferior acquaintance. 
I had gone to bed right after supper, but then I heard the piano music and pictured Joan and DeeDee and Loubelle, the blonde woman, and the rest of them, laughing and gossiping about me in the living room behind my back. They would be saying how awful it was to have people like me in Belsize and that I should be in Wymark instead. 
I decided to put a lid on their nasty talk. 
Draping my blanket loosely around my shoulders, like a stole, I wandered down the hall toward the light and the gay noise. 
For the rest of the evening I listened to DeeDee thump out some of her own songs on the grand piano, while the other women sat round playing bridge and chatting, just the way they would in a college dormitory, only most of them were ten years over college age. 
One of them, a great, tall, gray-haired woman with a booming bass voice, named Mrs. Savage, had gone to Vassar. I could tell right away she was a society woman, because she talked about nothing but debutantes. It seemed she had two or three daughters, and that year they were all going to be debutantes, only she had loused up their debutante party by signing herself into the asylum. 
DeeDee had one song she called "The Milkman" and everybody kept saying she ought to get it published, it would be a hit. First her hands would clop out a little melody on the keys, like the hoofbeats of a slow pony, and next another melody came in, like the milkman whistling, and then the two melodies went on together. 
"That's very nice," I said in a conversational voice. 
Joan was leaning on one corner of the piano and leafing through a new issue of some fashion magazine, and DeeDee smiled up at her as if the two of them shared a secret. 
"Oh, Esther," Joan said then, holding up the magazine, "isn't this you?" 
DeeDee stopped playing. "Let me see." She took the magazine, peered at the page Joan pointed to, and then glanced back at me. 
"Oh no," DeeDee said. "Surely not." She looked at the magazine again, then at me. "Never!" 
"Oh, but it is Esther, isn't it, Esther?" Joan said. 
Loubelle and Mrs. Savage drifted over, and pretending I knew what it was all about, I moved to the piano with them. 
The magazine photograph showed a girl in a strapless evening dress of fuzzy white stuff, grinning fit to split, with a whole lot of boys bending around her. The girl was holding a glass full of a transparent drink and seemed to have her eyes fixed over my shoulder on something that stood behind me, a little to my left. A faint breath fanned the back of my neck. I wheeled round. 
The night nurse had come in, unnoticed, on her soft rubber soles. 
"No kidding," she said, "is that really you?"  
"No, it's not me. Joan's quite mistaken. It's somebody else."  
"Oh, say it's you!" DeeDee cried. But I pretended I didn't hear her and turned away. Then Loubelle begged the nurse to make a fourth at bridge, and I drew up a chair to watch, although I didn't know the first thing about bridge, because I hadn't had time to pick it up at college, the way all the wealthy girls did. 
I stared at the flat poker faces of the kings and jacks and queens and listened to the nurse talking about her hard life. "You ladies don't know what it is, holding down two jobs," she said. "Nights I'm over here, watching you. . ." 
Loubelle giggled. "Oh, we're good. We're the best of the lot, and you know it." 
"Oh, you're all right" The nurse passed round a packet of spearmint gum, then unfolded a pink strap from its tinfoil wrapper herself. "You're all right, it's those boobies at the state place that worry me off my feet." 
"Do you work in both places then?" I asked with sudden interest. 
"You bet." The nurse gave me a straight look, and I could see she thought I had no business in Belsize at all. "You wouldn't like it over there one bit, Lady Jane." 
I found it strange that the nurse should call me Lady Jane when she knew what my name was perfectly well. 
"Why?" I persisted. 
"Oh, it's not a nice place, like this. This is a regular country club. Over there they've got nothing. No OT to talk of, no walks. . ." 
"Why haven't they got walks?" 
"Not enough em-ploy-ees." The nurse scooped in a trick and Loubelle groaned. "Believe me, ladies, when I collect enough do-re-mi to buy me a car, I'm clearing out." 
"Will you clear out of here, too?" Joan wanted to know. 
"You bet. Only private cases from then on. When I feel like it. . ." 
But I'd stopped listening. 
I felt the nurse had been instructed to show me my alternatives. Either I got better, or I fell, down, down, like a burning, then burnt-out star, from Belsize, to Caplan, to Wymark and finally, after Doctor Nolan and Mrs. Guinea had given me up, to the state place next door. 
I gathered my blanket round me and pushed back my chair. 
"You cold?" the nurse demanded rudely. 
"Yes," I said, moving off down the hall. "I'm frozen stiff." 
I woke warm and placid in my white cocoon. A shaft of pale, wintry sunlight dazzled the mirror and the glasses on the bureau and the metal doorknobs. From across the hall came the early-morning clatter of the maids in the kitchen, preparing the breakfast trays. 
I heard the nurse knock on the door next to mine, at the far end of the hall. Mrs. Savage's sleepy voice boomed out, and the nurse went in to her with the jingling tray. I thought, with a mild stir of pleasure, of the steaming blue china coffee pitcher and the blue china breakfast cup and the fat blue china cream jug with the white daisies on it 
I was beginning to resign myself. 
If I was going to fall, I would hang on to my small comforts, at least, as long as I possibly could. 
The nurse rapped on my door and, without waiting for an answer, breezed in. 
It was a new nurse -- they were always changing -- with a lean, sand-colored face and sandy hair, and large freckles polka-dotting her bony nose. For some reason the sight of this nurse made me sick at heart, and it was only as she strode across the room to snap up the green blind that I realized part of her strangeness came from being empty-handed. 
I opened my mouth to ask for my breakfast tray, but silenced myself immediately. The nurse would be mistaking me for somebody else. New nurses often did that. Somebody in Belsize must be having shock treatments, unknown to me, and the nurse had, quite understandably, confused me with her. 
I waited until the nurse had made her little circuit of my room, patting, straightening, arranging, and taken the next tray in to Loubelle one door farther down the hall. 
Then I shoved my feet into my slippers, dragging my blanket with me, for the morning was bright, but very cold, and crossed quickly to the kitchen. The pink-uniformed maid was filling a row of blue china coffee pitchers from a great, battered kettle on the stove. 
I looked with love at the lineup of waiting trays -- the white paper napkins, folded in their crisp, isosceles triangles, each under the anchor of its silver fork, the pale domes of soft-boiled eggs in the blue egg cups, the scalloped glass shells of orange marmalade. All I had to do was reach out and claim my tray, and the world would be perfectly normal. 
"There's been a mistake," I told the maid, leaning over the counter and speaking in a low, confidential tone. "The new nurse forgot to bring me in my breakfast tray today." 
I managed a bright smile, to show there were no hard feelings. 
"What's the name?" 
"Greenwood. Esther Greenwood." 
"Greenwood, Greenwood, Greenwood." The maid's warty index finger slid down the list of names of the patients in Belsize tacked upon the kitchen wall "Greenwood, no breakfast today." 
I caught the rim of the counter with both hands. 
"There must be a mistake. Are you sure it's Greenwood?" 
"Greenwood," the maid said decisively as the nurse came in. 
The nurse looked questioningly from me to the maid. "Miss Greenwood wanted her tray," the maid said, avoiding my eyes. 
"Oh," the nurse smiled at me, "you'll be getting your tray later on this morning, Miss Greenwood. You. . ." 
But I didn't wait to hear what the nurse said. I strode blindly out into the hall, not to my room, because that was where they would come to get me, but to the alcove, greatly inferior to the alcove at Caplan, but an alcove, nevertheless, in a quiet corner of the hall, where Joan and Loubelle and DeeDee and Mrs. Savage would not come. 
I curled up in the far corner of the alcove with the blanket over my head. It wasn't the shock treatment that struck me, so much as the bare-faced treachery of Doctor Nolan. I liked Doctor Nolan, I loved her, I had given her my trust on a platter and told her everything, and she had promised, faithfully, to warn me ahead of time if ever I had to have another shock treatment. 
If she had told me the night before I would have lain awake all night, of course, full of dread and foreboding, but by morning I would have been composed and ready. I would have gone down the hall between two nurses, past DeeDee and Loubelle and Mrs. Savage and Joan, with dignity, like a person coolly resigned to execution. 
The nurse bent over me and called my name. 
I pulled away and crouched farther into the corner. The nurse disappeared. I knew she would return, in a minute, with two burly men attendants, and they would bear me, howling and hitting, past the smiling audience now gathered in the lounge. 
Doctor Nolan put her arm around me and hugged me like a mother. 
"You said you'd tell me!" I shouted at her through the dishevelled blanket. 
 "But I am telling you," Doctor Nolan said. "I've come specially early to tell you, and I'm taking you over myself." 
I peered at her through swollen lids. "Why didn't you tell me last night?" 
"I only thought it would keep you awake. If I'd known. . ." 
"You said you'd tell me." 
"Listen, Esther," Doctor Nolan said. "I'm going over with you. I'll be there the whole time, so everything will happen right, the way I promised. I'll be there when you 
wake up, and I'll bring you back again." 
I looked at her. She seemed very upset 
I waited a minute. Then I said, "Promise you'll be there." 
 "I promise." 
Doctor Nolan took out a white handkerchief and wiped my face. Then she hooked her arm in my arm, like an old friend, and helped me up, and we started down the hall. My blanket tangled about my feet, so I let it drop, but Doctor Nolan didn't seem to notice. We passed Joan, coming out of her room, and I gave her a meaning, disdainful smile and she ducked back and waited until we had gone by. 
Then Doctor Nolan unlocked a door at the end of the hall and led me down a flight of stairs into the mysterious basement corridors that linked, in an elaborate network of tunnels and burrows, all the various buildings of the hospital. 
The walls were bright, white lavatory tile with bald bulbs set at intervals in the black ceiling. Stretchers and wheelchairs were beached here and there against the hissing, knocking pipes that ran and branched in an intricate nervous system along the glittering walls. I hung on to Doctor Nolan's arm like death, and every so often she gave me an encouraging squeeze. 
Finally, we stopped at a green door with Electrotherapy printed on it in black letters. I held back, and Doctor Nolan waited. Then I said, "Let's get it over with," and we went in. 
The only people in the waiting room besides Doctor Nolan and me were a pallid man in a shabby maroon bathrobe and his accompanying nurse. 
"Do you want to sit down?" Doctor Nolan pointed at a wooden bench, but my legs felt full of heaviness, and I thought how hard it would be to hoist myself from a sitting position when the shock treatment people came in. 
 "I'd rather stand." 
At last a tall, cadaverous woman in a white smock entered the room from an inner door. I thought that she would go up and take the man in the maroon bathrobe, as he was first, so I was surprised when she came toward me. 
"Good morning, Doctor Nolan," the woman said, putting her arm around my shoulders. "Is this Esther?" 
"Yes, Miss Huey. Esther, this is Miss Huey, she'll take good care of you. I've told her about you." 
I thought the woman must be seven feet tall. She bent over me in a kind way, and I could see that her face, with the buck teeth protruding in the center, had at one time been badly pitted with acne. It looked like maps of the craters on the moon. 
"I think we can take you right away, Esther," Miss Huey said. "Mr. Anderson won't mind waiting, will you, Mr. Anderson?" 
Mr. Anderson didn't say a word, so with Miss Huey's arm around my shoulder, and Doctor Nolan following, I moved into the next room. 
Through the slits of my eyes, which I didn't dare open too far, lest the full view strike me dead, I saw the high bed with its white, drumtight sheet, and the machine behind the bed, and the masked person -- I couldn't tell whether it was a man or a woman -- behind the machine, and other masked people flanking the bed on both sides. 
Miss Huey helped me climb up and lie down on my back.  
"Talk to me," I said. 
Miss Huey began to talk in a low, soothing voice, smoothing the salve on my temples and fitting the small electric buttons on either side of my head. "You'll be perfectly all right, you won't feel a thing, just bite down. . ." And she set something on my tongue and in panic I bit down, and darkness wiped me out like chalk on a blackboard. 

Eighteen
 "ESTHER." 
I woke out of a deep, drenched sleep, and the first thing I saw was Doctor Nolan's face swimming in front of me and saying, "Esther, Esther." 
I rubbed my eyes with an awkward hand. Behind Doctor Nolan I could see the body of a woman wearing a rumpled black-and-white checked robe and flung out on a cot as if dropped from a great height. But before I could take in any more, Doctor Nolan led me through a door into a fresh, blue-skied air. 
All the heat and fear purged itself. I felt surprisingly at peace. The bell jar hung, suspended, a few feet above my head. I was open to the circulating air. 
"It was like I told you it would be, wasn't it?" said Doctor Nolan, as we walked back to Belsize together through the crunch of brown leaves.  
"Yes." 
"Well, it will always be like that," she said firmly. "You will be having shock treatments three times a week -- Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday." 
I gulped in a long draught of air. 
"For how long?" 
"That depends," Doctor Nolan said, "on you and me." 
I took up the silver knife and cracked off the cap of my egg. Then I put down the knife and looked at it. I tried to think what I had loved knives for, but my mind slipped from the noose of the thought and swung, like a bird, in the center of empty air. 
Joan and DeeDee were sitting side by side on the piano bench, and DeeDee was teaching Joan to play the bottom half of "Chopsticks" while she played the top. 
I thought how sad it was Joan looked so horsey, with such big teeth and eyes like two gray, goggly pebbles. Why, she couldn't even keep a boy like Buddy Willard. And DeeDee's husband was obviously living with some mistress or other and turning her sour as an old fusty cat. 
"I've got a let-ter," Joan chanted, poking her tousled head inside my door. 
"Good for you." I kept my eyes on my book. Ever since the shock treatments had ended, after a brief series of five, and I had town privileges, Joan hung about me like a large and breathless fruitfly -- as if the sweetness of recovery were something she could suck up by mere nearness. They had taken away her physics books and the piles of dusty spiral pads full of lecture notes that had ringed her room, and she was confined to 
grounds again. 
"Don't you want to know who it's from?" 
Joan edged into the room and sat down on my bed. I wanted to tell her to get the hell out, she gave me the creeps, only I couldn't do it. 
"All right." I stuck my finger in my place and shut the book. "Who from?" 
Joan slipped out a pale blue envelope from her skirt pocket and waved it teasingly. 
"Well, isn't that a coincidence!" I said. 
"What do you mean, a coincidence?" 
I went over to my bureau, picked up a pale blue envelope and waved it at Joan like a parting handkerchief. "I got a letter too. I wonder if they're the same." 
"He's better," Joan said. "He's out of the hospital." 
There was a little pause. 
"Are you going to marry him?" 
"No," I said. "Are you?" 
Joan grinned evasively. "I didn't like him much, anyway." 
"Oh?" 
"No, it was his family I liked." 
"You mean Mr. and Mrs. Willard?" 
"Yes." Joan's voice slid down my spine like a draft. "I loved them. They were so nice, so happy, nothing like my parents. I went over to see them all the time," she paused, "until you came." 
"I'm sorry." Then I added, "Why didn't you go on seeing them, if you liked them so much?" 
"Oh, I couldn't," Joan said. "Not with you dating Buddy. It would have looked. . . I don't know, funny." 
I considered. "I suppose so." 
"Are you," Joan hesitated, "going to let him come?" 
"I don't know." 
At first I had thought it would be awful having Buddy come and visit me at the asylum -- he would probably only come to gloat and hobnob with the other doctors. But then it seemed to me it would be a step, placing him, renouncing him, in spite of the fact that I had nobody -- telling him there was no simultaneous interpreter, nobody, but that he was the wrong one, that I had stopped hanging on. "Are you?" 
"Yes," Joan breathed. "Maybe he'll bring his mother. I'm going to ask him to bring his mother. . ." 
"His mother?" 
Joan pouted. "I like Mrs. Willard. Mrs. Willard's a wonderful, wonderful woman. She's been a real mother to me." 
I had a picture of Mrs. Willard, with her heather-mixture tweeds and her sensible shoes and her wise, maternal maxims. Mr. Willard was her little boy, and his voice was high and dear, like a little boy's. Joan and Mrs. Willard. Joan. . . and Mrs. Willard. . . 
I had knocked on DeeDee's door that morning, wanting to borrow some two-part sheet music. I waited a few minutes and then, hearing no answer and thinking DeeDee must be out, and I could pick up the music from her bureau, I pushed the door open and stepped into the room. 
At Belsize, even at Belsize, the doors had locks, but the patients had no keys. A shut door meant privacy, and was respected, like a locked door. One knocked, and knocked again, then went away. I remembered this as I stood, my eyes half-useless after the brilliance of the hall, in the room's deep, musky dark. 
As my vision cleared, I saw a shape rise from the bed. Then somebody gave a low giggle. The shape adjusted its hair, and two pale, pebble eyes regarded me through the gloom. DeeDee lay back on the pillows, bare-legged under her green wool dressing gown, and watched me with a little mocking smile. A cigarette glowed between the fingers of her right hand. 
"I just wanted. . ." I said. 
"I know," said DeeDee. "The music." 
"Hello, Esther," Joan said then, and her cornhusk voice made me want to puke. "Wait for me, Esther, I'll come play the bottom part with you." 
Now Joan said stoutly, "I never really liked Buddy Willard. He thought he knew everything. He thought he knew everything about women. . ." 
I looked at Joan. In spite of the creepy feeling, and in spite of my old, ingrained dislike, Joan fascinated me. It was like observing a Martian, or a particularly warty toad. Her thoughts were not my thoughts, nor her feelings my feelings, but we were close enough so that her thoughts and feelings seemed a wry, black image of my own. 
Sometimes I wondered if I had made Joan up. Other times I wondered if she would continue to pop in at every crisis of my life to remind me of what I had been, and what I had been through, and carry on her own separate but similar crisis under my nose. 
"I don't see what women see in other women," I'd told Doctor Nolan in my interview that noon. "What does a woman see in a woman that she can't see in a man?" 
Doctor Nokn paused. Then she said, "Tenderness." 
That shut me up. 
"I like you," Joan was saying. "I like you better than Buddy." 
And as she stretched out on my bed with a silly smile, I remembered a minor scandal at our college dormitory when a fat, matronly-breasted senior, homely as a grandmother and a pious Religion major, and a tall, gawky freshman with a history of being deserted at an early hour in all sorts of ingenious ways by her blind dates, started seeing too much of each other. They were always together, and once somebody had come upon them embracing, the story went, in the fat girl's room. 
"But what were they doing?" I had asked. Whenever I thought about men and men, and women and women, I could never really imagine what they would be actually doing. 
"Oh," the spy had said, "Milly was sitting on the chair and Theodora was lying on the bed, and Milly was stroking Theodora's hair." 
I was disappointed. I had thought I would have some revelation of specific evil. I wondered if all women did with other women was lie and hug. 
Of course, the famous woman poet at my college lived with another woman -- a stumpy old Classical scholar with a cropped Dutch cut. And when I had told the poet I might well get married and have a pack of children someday, she stared at me in horror. "But what about your career?" she had cried. 
My head ached. Why did I attract these weird old women? There was the famous poet, and Philomena Guinea, and Jay Cee, and the Christian Scientist lady and lord knows who, and they all wanted to adopt me in some way, and, for the price of their care and influence, have me resemble them. 
"I like you." 
"That's tough, Joan," I said, picking up my book. "Because I don't like you. You make me puke, if you want to know." 
And I walked out of the room, leaving Joan lying, lumpy as an old horse, across my bed. 
I waited for the doctor, wondering if I should bolt. I knew what I was doing was illegal -- in Massachusetts, anyway, because the state was cram-jam full of Catholics -- but Doctor Nolan said this doctor was an old friend of hers, and a wise man. 
"What's your appointment for?" the brisk, white-uniformed receptionist wanted to know, ticking my name off on a notebook list. 
"What do you mean, for?" I hadn't thought anybody but the doctor himself would ask me that, and the communal waiting room was full of other patients waiting for other doctors, most of them pregnant or with babies, and I felt their eyes on my flat, virgin stomach. 
The receptionist glanced up at me, and I blushed. 
"A fitting, isn't it?" she said kindly. "I only wanted to make sure so I'd know what to charge you. Are you a student?" 
"Ye-es." 
"That will only be half-price then. Five dollars, instead of ten. Shall I bill you?" 
I was about to give my home address, where I would probably be by the time the bill arrived, but then I thought of my mother opening the bill and seeing what it was for. The only other address I had was the innocuous box number which people used who didn't want to advertise the fact they lived in an asylum. But I thought the receptionist might recognize the box number, so I said, "I better pay now," and peeled five dollar notes off the roll in my pocketbook. 
The five dollars was part of what Philomena Guinea had sent me as a sort of get-well present. I wondered what she would think if she knew to what use her money was being put. 
Whether she knew it or not, Philomena Guinea was buying my freedom, 
"What I hate is the thought of being under a man's thumb," I had told Doctor Nolan. "A man doesn't have a worry in the world, while I've got a baby hanging over my head like a big stick, to keep me in line." 
"Would you act differently if you didn't have to worry about a baby?" 
"Yes," I said, "but. . ." and I told Doctor Nolan about the married woman lawyer and her Defense of Chastity. 
Doctor Nolan waited until I was finished. Then she burst out laughing. "Propaganda!" she said, and scribbled the name and address of this doctor on a prescription pad. 
I leafed nervously through an issue of Baby Talk. The fat, bright faces of babies beamed up at me, page after page -- bald babies, chocolate-colored babies, Eisenhower-faced babies, babies rolling over for the first time, babies reaching for rattles, babies eating their first spoonful of solid food, babies doing all the little tricky things it takes to grow up, step by step, into an anxious and unsettling world. 
I smelt a mingling of Pablum and sour milk and salt-cod-stinky diapers and felt sorrowful and tender. HOW easy having babies seemed to the women around me! Why was I so unmaternal and apart? Why couldn't I dream of devoting myself to baby after fat puling baby like Dodo Conway? If I had to wait on a baby all day, I would go mad. I looked at the baby in the lap of the woman opposite. I had no idea how old it was, I never did, with babies -- for all I knew it could talk a blue streak and had twenty teeth behind its pursed, pink lips. It held its little wobby head up on its shoulders -- it didn't seem to have a neck -- and observed me with a wise, Platonic expression. 
The baby's mother smiled and smiled, holding that baby as if it were the first wonder of the world. I watched the mother and the baby for some clue to their mutual satisfaction, but before I had discovered anything, the doctor called me in. 
"You'd like a fitting," he said cheerfully, and I thought with relief that he wasn't the sort of doctor to ask awkward questions. I had toyed with the idea of telling him I planned to be married to a sailor as soon as his ship docked at the Charlestown Navy Yard, and the reason I didn't have an engagement ring was because we were too poor, but at the last moment I rejected that appealing story and simply said "Yes." 
I climbed up on the examination table, thinking: "I am climbing to freedom, freedom from fear, freedom from marrying the wrong person, like Buddy Willard, just because of sex, freedom from the Florence Crittenden Homes where all the poor girls go who should have been fitted out like me, because what they did, they would do anyway, regardless. . ." 
As I rode back to the asylum with my box in the plain brown paper wrapper on my lap I might have been Mrs. Anybody coming back from a day in town with a Schrafft's cake for her maiden aunt or a Filene's Basement hat. Gradually the suspicion that Catholics had X-ray eyes diminished, and I grew easy. I had done well by my shopping privileges, I thought. 
I was my own woman. 
The next step was to find the proper sort of man. 

Nineteen 
"I'm going to be a psychiatrist." 
Joan spoke with her usual breathy enthusiasm. We were drinking apple cider in the Belsize lounge. 
"Oh," I said dryly, "that's nice." 
"I've had a long talk with Doctor Quinn, and she thinks it's perfectly possible." Doctor Quinn was Joan's psychiatrist, a bright, shrewd, single lady, and I often thought if I had been assigned to Doctor Quinn I would be still in Caplan or, more probably, Wymark. Doctor Quinn had an abstract quality that appealed to Joan, but it gave me the polar chills. 
Joan chattered on about Egos and Ids, and I turned my mind to something else, to the brown, unwrapped package in my bottom drawer. I never talked about Egos and Ids 
with Doctor Nolan. I didn't know just what I talked about really. 
". . . I'm going to live out, now." 
I tuned in on Joan then. "Where?" I demanded, trying to hide my envy. 
Doctor Nolan said my college would take me back for the second semester, on her recommendation and Philomena Guinea's scholarship, but as the doctors vetoed my living with my mother in the interim, I was staying on at the asylum until the winter term began. 
Even so, I felt it unfair of Joan to beat me through the gates. 
"Where?" I persisted. "They're not letting you live on your own, are they?" Joan had only that week been given town privileges again. 
"Oh no, of course not. I'm living in Cambridge with Nurse Kennedy. Her roommate's just got married, and she needs someone to share the apartment." 
"Cheers." I raised my apple cider glass, and we clinked. In spite of my profound reservations, I thought I would always treasure Joan. It was as if we had been forced together by some overwhelming circumstance, like war or plague, and shared a world of our own. "When are you leaving?" 
"On the first.of the month." 
"Nice." 
Joan grew wistful "You'll come visit me, won't you, Esther?" 
 "Of course." 
But I thought, "Not likely." 
"It hurts," I said. "Is it supposed to hurt?" 
Irwin didn't say anything. Then he said, "Sometimes it hurts." 
I had met Irwin on the steps of the Widener Library. I was standing at the top of the long flight, overlooking the red brick buildings that walled the snow-filled quad and preparing to catch the trolley back to the asylum, when a tall young man with a rather ugly and bespectacled, but intelligent face, came up and said, "Could you please tell me the time?" 
I glanced at my watch. "Five past four." 
Then the man shifted his arms around the load of books he was carrying before him like a dinner tray and revealed a bony wrist. 
"Why, you've a watch yourself!" 
The man looked ruefully at his watch. He lifted it and shook it by his ear. "Doesn't work." He smiled engagingly. "Where are you going?" 
I was about to say, "Back to the asylum," but the man looked promising, so I changed my mind. "Home." 
"Would you like some coffee first?" 
I hesitated. I was due at the asylum for supper and I didn't want to be late so close to being signed out of there for good. 
 "A very small cup of coffee?" 
I decided to practice my new, normal personality on this man who, in the course of my hesitations, told me his name was Irwin and that he was a very well-paid professor of mathematics, so I said, "All right," and, matching my stride to Irwin's, strolled down the long, ice-encrusted flight at his side. 
It was only after seeing Irwin's study that I decided to seduce him. 
Irwin lived in a murky, comfortable basement apartment in one of the rundown streets of outer Cambridge and drove me there -- for a beer, he said -- after three cups of bitter coffee in a student cafe. We sat in his study on stuffed brown leather chairs, surrounded by stacks of dusty, incomprehensible books with huge formulas inset artistically on the page like poems. 
While I was sipping my first glass of beer -- I have never really cared for cold beer in midwinter, but I accepted the glass to have something solid to hold on to -- the doorbell rang. 
Irwin seemed embarrassed. "I think it may be a lady." 
Irwin had a queer, old-world habit of calling women ladies. 
"Fine, fine," I gestured largely. "Bring her in." 
Irwin shook his head. "You would upset her." 
I smiled into my amber cylinder of cold beer. 
The doorbell rang again with a peremptory jab. Irwin sighed and rose to answer it. The minute he disappeared, I whipped into the bathroom and, concealed behind the dirty, aluminum-colored Venetian blind, watched Irwin's monkish face appear in the door crack. 
A large, bosomy Slavic lady in a bulky sweater of natural sheep's wool, purple slacks, high-heeled black overshoes with Persian lamb cuffs and a matching toque, puffed white, inaudible words into the wintry air. Irwin's voice drifted back to me through the chilly hall. 
"I'm sorry, Olga. . . I'm working, Olga. . . no, I don't think so, Olga," all the while the lady's red mouth moved and the words, translated to white smoke, floated up among the branches of the naked lilac by the door. Then, finally, "Perhaps, Olga. . . good-bye, Olga." 
I admired the immense, steppelike expanse of the lady's wool-clad bosom as she retreated a few inches from my eye, down the creaking wooden stair, a sort of Siberian bitterness on her vivid lips. 
"I suppose you have lots and lots of affairs in Cambridge," I told Irwin cheerily, as I stuck a snail with a pin in one of Cambridge's determinedly French restaurants. 
"I seem," Irwin admitted with a small, modest smile, "to get on with the ladies." 
I picked up my empty snail shell and drank the herb-green juice. I had no idea if this was proper, but after months of wholesome, dull asylum diet, I was greedy for butter. 
I had called Doctor Nolan from a pay phone at the restaurant and asked for permission to stay overnight in Cambridge with Joan. Of course, I had no idea whether Irwin would invite me back to his apartment after dinner or not, but I thought his dismissal of the Slavic lady -- another professor's wife -- looked promising. 
I tipped back my head and poured down a glass of Nuits-St.-Georges. 
"You do like wine," Irwin observed. 
"Only Nuits-St.-Georges. I imagine him. . . with the dragon. . ." 
Irwin reached for my hand. 
I felt the first man I slept with must be intelligent, so I would respect him. Irwin was a full professor at twenty-six and had the pale, hairless skin of a boy genius. I also needed somebody quite experienced to make up for my lack of it, and Irwin's ladies reassured me on this head. Then, to be on the safe side, I wanted somebody I didn't know and wouldn't go on knowing -- a kind of impersonal, priestlike official, as in the tales of 
tribal rites. 
By the end of the evening I had no doubts about Irwin whatsoever. 
Ever since I'd learned about the corruption of Buddy Willard my virginity weighed like a millstone around my neck. It had been of such enormous importance to me for so long that my habit was to defend it at all costs. I had been defending it for five years and I was sick of it. 
It was only as Irwin swung me into his arms, back at the apartment, and carried me, wine-dazed and limp, into the pitch-black bedroom, that I murmured, "You know, Irwin, I think I ought to tell you, I'm a virgin." 
Irwin laughed and flung me down on the bed. 
A few minutes later an exclamation of surprise revealed that Irwin hadn't really believed me. I thought how lucky it was I had started practicing birth control during the day, because in my winey state that night I would never have bothered to perform the delicate and necessary operation. I lay, rapt and naked, on Irwin's rough blanket, waiting for the miraculous change to make itself felt. 
But all I felt was a sharp, startlingly bad pain. 
"It hurts," I said. "Is it supposed to hurt?" 
Irwin didn't say anything. Then he said, "Sometimes it hurts." 
After a little while Irwin got up and went into the bathroom, and I heard the rushing of shower water. I wasn't sure if Irwin had done what he planned to do, or if my virginity had obstructed him in some way. I wanted to ask him if I was still a virgin, but I felt too unsettled. A warm liquid was seeping out between my legs. Tentatively, I reached down and touched it. 
When I held my hand up to the light streaming in from the bathroom, my fingertips looked black. 
"Irwin," I said nervously, "bring me a towel." 
Irwin strolled back, a bathtowel knotted around his waist, and tossed me a second, smaller towel. I pushed the towel between my legs and pulled it away almost immediately. It was half black with blood. 
"I'm bleeding!" I announced, sitting up with a start. 
"Oh, that often happens," Irwin reassured me. "You'll be all right." 
Then the stories of blood-stained bridal sheets and capsules of red ink bestowed on already deflowered brides floated back to me. I wondered how much I would bleed, and lay down, nursing the towel. It occurred to me that the blood was my answer. I couldn't possibly be a virgin any more. I smiled into the dark. I felt part of a great tradition. 
Surreptitiously, I applied a fresh section of white towel to my wound, thinking that as soon as the bleeding stopped, I would take the late trolley back to the asylum. I wanted to brood over my new condition in perfect peace. But the towel came away black and dripping. 
"I. . . think I better go home," I said faintly. 
"Surely not so soon." 
"Yes, I think I better." 
I asked if I could borrow Irwin's towel and packed it between my thighs as a bandage. Then I pulled on my sweaty clothes. Irwin offered to drive me home, but I didn't see how I could let him drive me to the asylum, so I dug in my pocketbook for Joan's address. Irwin knew the street and went out to start the car. I was too worried to tell him I was still bleeding. I kept hoping every minute that it would stop. 
But as Irwin drove me through the barren, snow-banked streets I felt the warm seepage let itself through the dam of the towel and my skirt and onto the car seat. 
As we slowed, cruising by house after lit house, I thought how fortunate it was I had not discarded my virginity while living at college or at home, where such concealment would have been impossible. 
Joan opened the door with an expression of glad surprise. Irwin kissed my hand and told Joan to take good care of me. 
I shut the door and leaned back against it, feeling the blood drain from my face in one spectacular flush. 
"Why, Esther," Joan said, "what on earth's the matter?" I wondered when Joan would notice the blood trickling down my legs and oozing, stickily, into each black patent leather shoe. I thought I could be dying from a bullet wound and Joan would still stare through me with her blank eyes, expecting me to ask for a cup of coffee and a sandwich. 
"Is that nurse here?" 
"No, she's on night duty at Caplan. . ."  
"Good." I made a little bitter grin as another soak of blood let itself through the drenched padding and started the tedious journey into my shoes. "I mean. . . bad."  
"You look funny," Joan said. 
 "You better get a doctor."  
 "Why?" 
"Quick" 
"But. . ." 
Still she hadn't noticed anything. 
I bent down, with a brief grunt, and slipped off one of my winter-cracked black Bloomingdale shoes. I held the shoe up, before Joan's enlarged, pebbly eyes, tilted it, and watched her take in the stream of blood that cascaded onto the beige rug. 
"My God! What is it?" 
 "I'm hemorrhaging." 
Joan half led, half dragged me to the sofa and made me lie down. Then she propped some pillows under my bloodstained feet. Then she stood back and demanded, "Who was that man?" 
For one crazy minute I thought Joan would refuse to call a doctor until I confessed the whole story of my evening with Irwin and that after my confession she would still refuse, as a sort of punishment. But then I realized that she honestly took my explanation at face value, that my going to bed with Irwin was utterly incomprehensible to her, and his appearance a mere prick to her pleasure at my arrival. 
"Oh somebody," I said, with a flabby gesture of dismissal. Another pulse of blood released itself and I contracted my stomach muscles in alarm. "Get a towel." 
Joan went out and came back almost immediately with a pile of towels and sheets. Like a prompt nurse, she peeled back my blood-wet clothes, drew a quick breath as she arrived at the original royal red towel, and applied a fresh bandage. I lay, trying to slow the beating of my heart, as every beat pushed forth another gush of blood. 
I remembered a worrisome course in the Victorian novel where woman after woman died, palely and nobly, in torrents of blood, after a difficult childbirth. Perhaps Irwin had injured me in some awful, obscure way, and all the while I lay there on Joan's sofa I was really dying. 
Joan pulled up an Indian hassock and began to dial down the long list of Cambridge doctors. The first number didn't answer. Joan began to explain my case to the second number, which did answer, but then broke off and said "I see" and hung up. 
"What's the trouble?" 
"He'll only come for regular customers or emergencies. It's Sunday." 
I tried to lift my arm and look at my watch, but my hand was a rock at my side and wouldn't budge. Sunday -- the doctor's paradise! Doctors at country clubs, doctors at the seaside, doctors with mistresses, doctors with wives, doctors in church, doctors in yachts, doctors everywhere resolutely being people, not doctors. 
"For God's sake," I said, "tell them I'm an emergency." The third number didn't answer and, at the fourth, the party hung up the minute Joan mentioned it was about a period. Joan began to cry. 
"Look, Joan," I said painstakingly, "call up the local hospital. Tell them it's an emergency. They'll have to take me." 
Joan brightened and dialed a fifth number. The Emergency Service promised her a staff doctor would attend to me if I could come in to the ward. Then Joan called a taxi. 
Joan insisted on riding with me. I clasped my fresh padding of towels with a sort of desperation as the cabby, impressed by the address Joan gave him, cut corner after corner in the dawn-pale streets and drew up with a great squeal of tires at the Emergency Ward entrance. 
I left Joan to pay the driver and hurried into the empty, glaringly lit room. A nurse bustled out from behind a white screen. In a few swift words, I managed to tell her the truth about my predicament before Joan came in the door, blinking and wide-eyed as a myopic owl 
The Emergency Ward doctor strolled out then, and I climbed, with the nurse's help, on to the examining table. The nurse whispered to the doctor, and the doctor nodded and began unpacking the bloody toweling. I felt his fingers start to probe, and Joan stood, rigid as a soldier, at my side, holding my hand, for my sake or hers I couldn't tell. 
"Ouch!" I winced at a particularly bad jab. 
 The doctor whistled. 
"You're one in a million." 
"What do you mean?" 
"I mean it's one in a million it happens to like this." 
The doctor spoke in a low, curt voice to the nurse, and she hurried to a side table and brought back some rolls of gauze and silver instruments. "I can see," the doctor bent down, "exactly where the trouble is coming from." 
"But can you fix it?" 
The doctor laughed. "Oh, I can fix it, all right." 
I was roused by a tap on my door. It was past midnight, and the asylum quiet as death. I couldn't imagine who would still be up. 
"Come in!" I switched on the bedside light. The door clicked open, and Doctor Quinn's brisk, dark head appeared in the crack. I looked at her with surprise, because although I knew who she was, and often passed her, with a brief nod, in the asylum hall, I never spoke to her at all. 
Now she said, "Miss Greenwood, may I come in a minute?" I nodded. 
Doctor Quinn stepped into the room, shutting the door quietly behind her. She was wearing one of her navy blue, immaculate suits with a plain, snow-white blouse showing in the V of the neck. 
"I'm sorry to bother you, Miss Greenwood, and especially at this time of night, but I thought you might be able to help us out about Joan." 
For a minute I wondered if Doctor Quinn was going to blame me for Joan's return to the asylum. I still wasn't sure how much Joan knew, after our trip to the Emergency Ward, but a few days later she had come back to live in Belsize, retaining, however, the freest of town privileges. 
"I'll do what I can," I told Doctor Quinn.  
Doctor Quinn sat down on the edge of my bed with a grave face. "We would like to find out where Joan is. We thought you might have an idea." 
Suddenly I wanted to dissociate myself from Joan completely. "I don't know," I said coldly. "Isn't she in her room?" It was well after the Belsize curfew hour.  
"No, Joan had a permit to go to a movie in town this evening, and she's not back yet." 
"Who was she with?" 
"She was alone." Doctor Quinn paused. "Have you any idea where she might be likely to spend the night?" 
"Surely she'll be back. Something must have held her up." But I didn't see what could have held Joan up in tame night Boston. 
Doctor Quinn shook her head. "The last trolley went by an hour ago." 
"Maybe she'll come back by taxi."  
Doctor Quinn sighed. 
"Have you tried the Kennedy girl?" I went on. "Where Joan used to live?" 
Doctor Quinn nodded. 
 "Her family?" 
"Oh, she'd never go there. . . but we've tried them, too." 
Doctor Quinn lingered a minute, as if she could sniff out some clue in the still room. Then she said, "Well, we'll do what we can," and left. 
I turned out the light and tried to drop back to sleep, but Joan's face floated before me, bodiless and smiling, like the face of the Cheshire cat. I even thought I heard her voice, rustling and hushing through the dark, but then I realized it was only the night wind in the asylum trees. . . 
Another tap woke me in the frost-gray dawn. 
This time I opened the door myself. 
Facing me was Doctor Quinn. She stood at attention, like a frail drill sergeant, but her outlines seemed curiously smudged. 
"I thought you should know," Doctor Quinn said. "Joan has been found." 
Doctor Quinn's use of the passive slowed my blood. 
 "Where?" 
"In the woods, by the frozen ponds. . ." 
I opened my mouth, but no words came out. 
"One of the orderlies found her," Doctor Quinn continued, "just now, coming to work. . ." 
"She's not. . ." 
"Dead," said Doctor Quinn. "I'm afraid she's hanged herself." 

Twenty
 A FRESH FALL OF SNOW blanketed the asylum grounds -- not a Christmas sprinkle, but a man-high January deluge, the sort that snuffs out schools and offices and churches, and leaves, for a day or more, a pure, blank sheet in place of memo pads, date books and calendars. 
In a week, if I passed my interview with the board of directors, Philomena Guinea's large black car would drive me west and deposit me at the wrought-iron gates of my college. 
The heart of winter! 
Massachusetts would be sunk in a marble calm. I pictured the snowflaky, Grandma Moses villages, the reaches of swampland rattling with dried cattails, the ponds where frog and hornpout dreamed in a sheath of ice, and the shivering woods. 
But under the deceptively clean and level slate the topography was the same, and instead of San Francisco or Europe or Mars I would be learning the old landscape, brook and hill and tree. In one way it seemed a small thing, starting, after a six months' lapse, where I had so vehemently left off. 
Everybody would know about me, of course. 
Doctor Nolan had said, quite bluntly, that a lot of people would treat me gingerly, or even avoid me, like a leper with a warning bell. My mother's face floated to mind, a pale, reproachful moon, at her last and first visit to the asylum since my twentieth birthday. A daughter in an asylum! I had done that to her. Still, she had obviously decided to forgive me. 
"We'll take up where we left off, Esther," she had said, with her sweet, martyr's smile. "Well act as if all this were a bad dream." 
A bad dream. 
To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is the bad dream. 
A bad dream. 
I remembered everything. 
I remembered the cadavers and Doreen and the story of the fig tree and Marco's diamond and the sailor on the Common and Doctor Gordon's wall-eyed nurse and the broken thermometers and the Negro with his two kinds of beans and the twenty pounds I gained on insulin and the rock that bulged between sky and sea like a gray skull. 
Maybe forgetfulness, like a kind of snow, should numb and cover them. 
But they were part of me. They were my landscape. 
"A man to see you!" 
The smiling, snow-capped nurse poked her head in through the door, and for a confused second I thought I really was back in college and this spruce white furniture, this white view over trees and hills, an improvement on my old room's nicked chairs and desk and outlook over the bald quad. "A man to see you!" the girl on watch had said, on the dormitory phone. 
What was there about us, in Belsize, so different from the girls playing bridge and gossiping and studying in the college to which I would return? Those girls, too, sat under bell jars of a sort. 
"Come in!" I called, and Buddy Willard, khaki cap in hand, stepped into the room. 
"Well, Buddy," I said. 
 "Well, Esther." 
We stood there, looking at each other. I waited for a touch of emotion, the faintest glow. Nothing. Nothing but a great, amiable boredom. Buddy's khaki-jacketed shape seemed small and unrelated to me as the brown posts he had stood against that day a year ago, at the bottom of the ski run. 
"How did you get here?" I asked finally. 
 "Mother's car." 
"In all this snow?" 
"Well," Buddy grinned, "I'm stuck outside in a drift. The hill was too much for me. Is there anyplace I can borrow a shovel?" 
"We can get a shovel from one of the groundsmen." 
"Good." Buddy turned to go. 
"Wait, I'll come and help you." 
Buddy looked at me then, and in his eyes I saw a flicker of strangeness -- the same compound of curiosity and wariness I had seen in the eyes of the Christian Scientist and my old English teacher and the Unitarian minister who used to visit me. 
"Oh, Buddy," I laughed. "I'm all right." 
"Oh, I know, I know, Esther," Buddy said hastily. 
"It's you who oughtn't to dig out cars, Buddy. Not me." 
And Buddy did let me do most of the work. 
The car had skidded on the glassy hill up to the asylum and backed, with one wheel over the rim of the drive, into a steep drift. 
The sun, emerged from its gray shrouds of clouds, shone with a summer brillance on the untouched slopes. Pausing in my work to overlook that pristine expanse, I felt the same profound thrill it gives me to see trees and grassland waist-high under flood water -- as if the usual order of the world had shifted slightly, and entered a new phase. 
I was grateful for the car and the snowdrift. It kept Buddy from asking me what I knew he was going to ask, and what he finally did ask, in a low, nervous voice, at the Belsize afternoon tea. DeeDee was eyeing us like an envious cat over the rim of her teacup. After Joan's death, DeeDee had been moved to Wymark for a while, but now she was among us once more. 
"I've been wondering. . ." Buddy set his cup in the saucer with an awkward clatter. 
"What have you been wondering?" 
"I've been wondering. . . I mean, I thought you might be able to tell me something." Buddy met my eyes and I saw, for the first time, how he had changed. Instead of the old, sure smile that flashed on easily and frequently as a photographer's bulb, his face was grave, even tentative -- the face of a man who often does not get what he wants. 
"I'll tell you if I can, Buddy." 
"Do you think there's something in me that drives women crazy?" 
I couldn't help myself, I burst out laughing -- maybe because of the seriousness of Buddy's face and the common meaning of the word "crazy" in a sentence like that. 
"I mean," Buddy pushed on, "I dated Joan, and then you, and first you. . . went, and then Joan. . ." 
With one finger I nudged a cake crumb into a drop of wet, brown tea. 
"Of course you didn't do it!" I heard Doctor Nolan say. I had come to her about Joan, and it was the only time I remember her sounding angry. "Nobody did it. She did it." And then Doctor Nolan told me how the best of psychiatrists have suicides among their patients, and how they, if anybody, should be held responsible, but how they, on the contrary, do not hold themselves responsible. . . 
"You had nothing to do with us, Buddy." 
 "You're sure?" 
"Absolutely." 
"Well," Buddy breathed. "I'm glad of that." 
And he drained his tea like a tonic medicine. 
"I hear you're leaving us." 
I fell into step beside Valerie in the little, nurse-supervised group. "Only if the doctors say yes. I have my interview tomorrow." 
The packed snow creaked underfoot, and everywhere I could hear a musical trickle and drip as the noon sun thawed icicles and snow crusts that would glaze again before nightfall. 
The shadows of the massed black pines were lavender in that bright light, and I walked with Valerie awhile, down the familiar labyrinth of shoveled asylum paths. Doctors and nurses and patients passing on adjoining paths seemed to be moving on casters, cut off at the waist by the piled snow. 
"Interviews!" Valerie snorted. "They're nothing! If they're going to let you out, they let you out." 
"I hope so." 
In front of Caplan I said good-bye to Valerie's calm, snow-maiden face behind which so little, bad or good, could happen, and walked on alone, my breath coming in white puffs even in that sun-filled air. Valerie's last, cheerful cry had been "So long! Be seeing you." 
"Not if I know it," I thought. 
But I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure at all. How did I know that someday -- at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere -- the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again? 
And hadn't Buddy said, as if to revenge himself for my digging out the car and his having to stand by, "I wonder who you'll marry now, Esther." 
"What?" I'd said, shoveling snow up onto a mound and blinking against the stinging backshower of loose flakes. 
"I wonder who you'll marry now, Esther. Now you've been," and Buddy's gesture encompassed the hill, the pines and the severe, snow-gabled buidlings breaking up the rolling landscape, "here." 
And of course I didn't know who would marry me now that I'd been where I had been. I didn't know at all. 
"I have a bill here, Irwin." 
I spoke quietly into the mouthpiece of the asylum pay phone in the main hall of the administration building. At first I suspected the operator, at her switchboard, might be listening, but she just went on plugging and unplugging her little tubes without batting an eye. 
"Yes," Irwin said. 
"It's a bill for twenty dollars for emergency attention on a certain date in December and a checkup a week thereafter." 
"Yes," Irwin said. 
"The hospital says they are sending me the bill because there was no answer to the bill they sent to you." 
"All right, all right, I'm writing a check now. I'm writing them a blank check." Irwin's voice altered subtly. "When am I going to see you?" 
"Do you really want to know?"
 "Very much." 
"Never," I said, and hung up with a resolute click. 
I wondered, briefly, if Irwin would send his check to the hospital after that, and then I thought, "Of course he will, he's a mathematics professor -- he won't want to leave any loose ends." 
I felt unaccountably weak-kneed and relieved. 
Irwin's voice had meant nothing to me. 
This was the first time, since our first and last meeting, that I had spoken with him and, I was reasonably sure, it would be the last. Irwin had absolutely no way of getting in touch with me, except by going to Nurse Kennedy's flat, and after Joan's death Nurse Kennedy had moved somewhere else and left no trace. 
I was perfectly free. 
Joan's parents invited me to the funeral. 
I had been, Mrs. Gilling said, one of Joan's best friends. 
"You don't have to go, you know," Doctor Nolan told me. "You can always write and say I said it would be better not to." 
"I'll go," I said, and I did go, and all during the simple funeral service I wondered what I thought I was burying. 
At the altar the coffin loomed in its snow pallor of flowers -- the black shadow of something that wasn't there. The faces in the pews around me were waxen with candlelight, and pine boughs, left over from Christmas, sent up a sepulchral incense in the cold air. 
Beside me, Jody's cheeks bloomed like good apples, and here and there in the little congregation I recognized other faces of other girls from college and my home town who had known Joan. DeeDee and Nurse Kennedy bent their kerchiefed heads in a front pew. 
Then, behind the coffin and the flowers and the face of the minister and the faces of the mourners, I saw the rolling lawns of our town cemetery, knee-deep in snow now, with the tombstones rising out of it like smokeless chimneys. 
There would be a black, six-foot-deep gap hacked in the hard ground. That shadow would marry this shadow, and the peculiar, yellowish soil of our locality seal the wound in the whiteness, and yet another snowfall erase the traces of newness in Joan's grave. 
I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. 
I am, I am, I am. 
The doctors were having their weekly board meeting -- old business, new business, admissions, dismissals and interviews. Leafing blindly through a tatty National Geographic in the asylum library, I waited my turn. 
Patients, with accompanying nurses, made their rounds of the stocked shelves, conversing in low tones, with the asylum librarian, an alumna of the asylum herself. Glancing at her -- myopic, spinsterish, effaced -- I wondered how she knew she had graduated at all, and, unlike her clients, was whole and well. 
"Don't be scared," Doctor Nolan had said. "I'll be there, and the rest of the doctors you know, and some visitors, and Doctor Vining, the head of all the doctors, will ask you a few questions, and then you can go." 
But in spite of Doctor Nolan's reassurances, I was scared to death. 
I had hoped, at my departure, I would feel sure and knowledgeable about everything that lay ahead -- after all, I had been "analyzed." Instead, all I could see were question marks. 
I kept shooting impatient glances at the closed boardroom door. My stocking seams were straight, my black shoes cracked, but polished, and my red wool suit flamboyant as my plans. Something old, something new. . . 
But I wasn't getting married. There ought, I thought, to be a ritual for being born twice -- patched, retreaded and approved for the road, I was trying to think of an appropriate one when Doctor Nolan appeared from nowhere and touched me on the shoulder. 
"All right, Esther." 
I rose and followed her to the open door. 
Pausing, for a brief breath, on the threshold, I saw the silver-haired doctor who had told me about the rivers and the Pilgrims on my first day, and the pocked, cadaverous face of Miss Huey, and eyes I thought I had recognized over white masks. 
The eyes and the faces all turned themselves toward me, and guiding myself by them, as by a magical thread, I stepped into the room.
